        "location": "Budapest",
        "short_desc": "Budapest, the capital of Hungary and considered by many to be the \"Paris of the East,\" is one of the most culturally important metropolises in Eastern Europe, and is home to numerous UNESCO World Heritage Sites.",
        "full_desc": "<p><strong>1. Buda Castle &amp; Castle Hill :</strong> Towering over the Danube, Budapest&#39;s Castle Hill (V&aacute;rhegy) contains many of the city&#39;s most important medieval monuments and museums. Topping the list of these impressive structures is the 18th-century Buda Castle (Budav&aacute;ri Palota), a massive 200-room palace that replaced a 13th-century castle built to protect the stronghold from Mongol and Tartar attacks. Although badly damaged in World War II, much of the exterior has been restored, along with sections of the interior, which now houses a number of important museums. These include the Hungarian National Gallery in the main wing, while in the south wing, the Budapest History Museum occupies four floors. In front of the castle, overlooking the Danube, stands a bronze equestrian statue of Prince Eugene of Savoy, a hero of Turkish attacks on the city. Castle Hill is worth exploring for its medieval lanes and it Romanesque, Gothic, and Baroque architecture. This entire historic complex is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Like much of the city, Buda Castle is spectacularly illuminated at night, and the castle courtyards remain open 24 hours a day. You can reach the castle on the restored historic Castle Funicular Railway, which departs from the Buda end of the Chain Bridge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2. Hungarian Parliament Building &amp; Crown Jewels:</strong> A highlight of a walk around Budapest&#39;s lovely pedestrian-friendly cobbled streets is the area around the country&#39;s architecturally pleasing Parliament building (Orsz&aacute;gh&aacute;z), along with its neighbours, the Museum of Ethnography and the Ministry of Agriculture. The world&#39;s third-largest parliament building, this Neo-Gothic building was inaugurated in 1886 to mark the country&#39;s 1,000th anniversary. (Hungary was then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.) This impressive structure boasts 691 rooms, as well as an impressive 19 kilometres of corridors and stairs. Guided tours last approximately 45 minutes and are available whenever the government is not sitting, and include many of the building&#39;s highlights, such as the main entrance hall, various lobbies, and the Hungarian Crown Jewels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3. St. Stephen&#39;s Basilica:</strong> Budapest&#39;s St. Stephen&#39;s Basilica (Szent Istv&aacute;n-bazilika) is a popular attraction for its impressive architecture, the beauty of its interior, and the panoramic views from its dome. The cathedral is dedicated to St. Stephen, Hungary&#39;s holy king and the founder of the Hungarian state, and construction began in 1851, but after several construction setbacks&mdash;including the collapse of its unfinished dome&mdash;it was not dedicated until 1905. The roof, towers, and external walls were badly damaged in World War II, and the church&#39;s precious mosaics fell from the walls. However, these were successfully restored to their original place and are the highlight of the richly decorated interior. The most impressive of these, the five-part Venetian mosaic is in the sanctuary and represents the allegories of the mass. The cathedral&#39;s most precious holy relic, the mummified right hand of the church&#39;s patron saint, the first king of Hungary, is displayed under glass in the chapel to the left of the high altar. One of the best things to do here, if time permits, is to take one of the two elevators that carry visitors up to the cupola for sweeping 360-degree views over the city and the Danube (alternatively, you can climb the 364 steps). Guided tours of the basilica are available on weekdays. Also, be sure to check the cathedral&#39;s website for details of one of its frequent organ and classical music concerts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>4. Fisherman&#39;s Bastion: </strong>Overlooking the Danube, on the spot where the city&#39;s fishermen&#39;s guild built their defence walls in the Middle Ages, stands the impressive Fisherman&#39;s Bastion (Hal&aacute;szb&aacute;stya). This exquisite collection of Neo-Romanesque towers, courtyards, colonnades, and walls was built between 1895 and 1902 and is one of the most popular points in the city for tourists, largely for its spectacular views over the city and the Danube. While here, be sure to look for the bronze equestrian statue of St. Stephen, the first King of Hungary, in the south courtyard. The reliefs on the sides of the base depict scenes from Stephen&#39;s life and make for an incredible selfie backdrop. A variety of English language tour options are available.</p>",

        "location": "Amsterdam",
        "short_desc": "Visit the world-famous 17th century capital of Holland. Enjoy the historic buildings, beautiful museums and pleasant ambiance. Go for a boat tour on the canals, stroll through Vondelpark, and go shopping in the inner city. Amsterdam is a unique city!",
        "full_desc": "<p><strong>My Eating &amp; Drinking experience</strong>: Soul food, French or international cuisine? Amsterdam boasts several Michelin star restaurants as well as many great bistros and terraces. Go for a tour on the Pannenkoekenboot (Pancake Boat), enjoy a vegan snack, or grab a quintessentially Dutch frikandel &#39;from the wall&#39; at Febo. Where to eat in Amsterdam? This city has it all! Amsterdam offers so much more to see and do than the big-hitting attractions and famous museums. Venture into the neighbourhoods surrounding the city centre to find hidden gems such as inspiring art museums, gardens, historic breweries and unique dining concepts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>My Explore Experience of Amsterdam&rsquo;s art and Museums:&nbsp;</strong> Amsterdam&rsquo;s rich history and artistic prowess mean there&rsquo;s no shortage of museums and cultural venues. If you&rsquo;ve already seen the Rijksmuseum (or even if you haven&rsquo;t) pay a visit to the Moco Museum, which showcases a privately-owned collection of contemporary art by Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein and Banksy. Amsterdam also has a strong tradition in architecture, and the city&rsquo;s distinctive style known as the Amsterdam School can be explored in more depth at Museum Het Schip. The iconic brick building was originally constructed as a highly regarded social housing initiative, which provided 102 homes to working-class residents. The museum explains the characteristics of the Amsterdam School style as well as the social ideology behind it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>My Experience of Music:</strong>&nbsp;Film and Events One of the city&rsquo;s top-rated venues for live music is the Tolhuistuin in Amsterdam Noord. A free ferry runs across the IJ River, transporting passengers from Amsterdam Central Station to the Tolhuistuin&rsquo;s doorstep. The venue presents a varied programme of music and club nights organised by Paradiso &ndash; another popular venue in central Amsterdam. Music, art and culture also come together at Westergasfabriek, the city&rsquo;s former gasworks in Westerpark. This atmospheric space hosts a variety of events, from food festivals to exhibitions and fashion shows. Another cultural space with a fascinating history is De Hallen: known for the Filmhallen, a boutique cinema, and the Foodhallen, an upmarket food hall serving culinary delights from every corner of the world. The group of spacious buildings, which also include shops, galleries, a hotel and apartments, used to be one of the city&rsquo;s tram depots. Hidden hotspots in outer neighbourhoods Dating back to 1638, Amsterdam&rsquo;s botanical gardens, Hortus Botanicus Amsterdam, is a sanctuary for rare and exotic plants, many of which were collected on Dutch voyages to far-flung countries. Visitors can wander through the garden, exploring the greenhouses filled with palms and butterflies and the medicinal herb gardens. In the east of Amsterdam, you&rsquo;ll also find one of the city&rsquo;s oldest markets, the Dappermarkt, held from Monday to Sunday. Vendors sell everything from fresh vegetables and flowers to clothing and home furnishings. Another opportunity to immerse yourself in Amsterdam&rsquo;s authentic culture is to visit the NDSM neighbourhood across the River IJ. The former shipyard has been completely renovated. Emblazoned with colourful graffiti, it&rsquo;s now home to a community of artists. In summer, locals flock to the beach bar and cafe Pllek (meaning &lsquo;place&rsquo;) for performances, parties, open-air film screenings and to sunbathe on the sandy riverbank.</p>",

There are airport shuttles to get you into town, as well as Uber, Lyft or Taxi. Once on the beach, rideshares and taxis are plentiful and many activities are within walking distance depending on where you decide to stay. There is even the South Beach local bus for only 0.25 cents per ride! The Miami Mover (above ground train) can take you from the airport to downtown and Brickell. This is a good way to get around if you are visiting these areas and don&rsquo;t want to have a car. </span><span style=\"background-color:#ffffff; color:#535353\">If you&rsquo;re feeling extra touristy and want your transportation easily taken care of, hop on a! No shame, I promise &ndash; I&rsquo;ve done it in various cities around the world.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color:#ffffff; color:#535353\"><strong>WHEN TO GO</strong> : Miami boasts great weather year-round, but beware of hurricane season between June and October. As someone who has lived there 13 years, I think August and September are the worst months. The weather is rainy and hot those months, but from November to May, it&rsquo;s absolutely gorgeous. Like any tropical place, rain is always in the forecast, but sometimes will be a short isolated shower. January and February can actually be &ldquo;chilly&rdquo; &mdash; anything under 70 degrees Fahrenheit is considered cold to a South Floridian! Try not to laugh! You also need to consider the various events in Miami, because, well, there&rsquo;s a lot and they can greatly impact your stay! February: The Food and Wine Festival is in South Beach. March: Ultra Music Festival and Winter Music Conference. There will be crowds and inevitably, hotels will be much more expensive. The Miami Tennis Open on Key Biscayne is also in March. Memorial Day weekend is Urban Beach Week. Art Basel is in early December. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color:#ffffff; color:#535353\"><strong>IMPORTANT THINGS TO PACK :&nbsp;</strong> Miami is both the most casual and the dressiest city. I know, it makes no sense! What that means is you can be as dressy as you want or as casual as you want. Tank tops, shorts, and flip flops are the South Beach &ldquo;uniform&rdquo;. At a trendy restaurant or club, you will see designer dresses and 5-inch stilettos. Jeans and a nice shirt are fine for just about anywhere. Obviously, a bathing suit and cover-up are must-pack items! And don&rsquo;t forget sunglasses, because the sun is bright!</span></p>",

You never know, a simple &lsquo;Spain vacation&rsquo; may actually develop into something more long-term, be it an extended stay, a never-ending obsession or both! Spain has a way of enchanting its visitors and convincing them to stay longer than planned like no other country I&rsquo;ve ever known.

While a trip to one of Spain&rsquo;s lush and sizzling islands may not initially feature in your &lsquo;Spain travel&rsquo; itinerary, you&rsquo;ll be delighted to know that flights to the Balearic or Canary Islands from major gateways&nbsp;such as Madrid and Malaga are not expensive, providing you book enough in advance.

In the twelfth century, it was fortified and became home to Edo Castle (Imperial Palace).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Culture:</strong><br />\r\n<span style=\"color:#2a2a2a\">Tokyo is the cultural centre of Japan having originated from the Jomon culture with influences from China, Korea, Europe and America who impacted the culture massively to create a culture that is vibrant, exciting and truly one of a kind.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Religion:</strong><br />\r\n<span style=\"color:#2a2a2a\">Religion doesn&#39;t play a big part in the lives of most Japanese people however Religious customs are still practised and religious holidays are still celebrated. The two main types of religion commonly practised in Japan are Shintoism and Buddhism or a combination of both.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Sporting:</strong><br />\r\n<span style=\"color:#2a2a2a\">Tokyo has many major world-class sporting stadiums which will soon play host to the Summer Olympics which is sure to be electric if the other Olympics held in Tokyo previously are any sort of prediction.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Cuisine:</strong><br />\r\n<span style=\"color:#2a2a2a\">In Tokyo and most of Japan cuisine plays a massive part in citizens life, with traditional food which has been made for centuries to modern and innovative food which is thoroughly beautiful, Tokyo has it all.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Transport:</strong><br />\r\n<span style=\"color:#2a2a2a\">The Tokyo public transport system is the fastest and most convenient way to travel around the city.</span><strong><span style=\"color:#2a2a2a\">&nbsp;</span></strong></p>",
        "Reasons_to_visit": "<p><strong>The world&#39;s most sophisticated railways</strong>:&nbsp;With 13 subway lines and more than 100 surface routes run by Japan Railways and other private companies, Tokyo&#39;s railway system seems like it was designed to win world records. It&#39;s rare to find a location in the metropolitan area that can&#39;t be reached with a train ride and a short walk.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Emperor will see you now</strong>:&nbsp;Visit the Imperial Palace on December 23 or January 2, and you&#39;ll see something impressive: its owner.

        "Explain_each_feature": "<p><strong>Architecture &amp; Gardens</strong>:&nbsp;Japan&rsquo;s traditional design aesthetic of clean lines, natural materials, heightened spatial awareness and subtle enhancement has inspired artists and designers around the world.Early Japanese architecture was greatly indebted to Chinese building technology, design motifs and geomancy. From the introduction of Buddhism in the 6th century through the medieval period, temples&nbsp;<em>(tera</em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em>ji)</em>&nbsp;were Japan&#39;s most important works of architecture and thus exerted a strong stylistic influence on all other types of structures; it was often through Buddhism that new styles and techniques entered Japan from the continent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Flowering plants are only one component of the Japanese garden, which may be composed of any combination of vegetation (including trees, shrubs and moss), stones of varying sizes and water. Some gardens are not limited to that which falls within their walls, but take into account the scenery beyond (a technique called&nbsp;<em>shakkei</em>&nbsp;or &#39;borrowed scenery&#39;). Often they are meant to evoke a landscape in miniature, with rocks standing in for famous mountains of myth or Chinese literature; raked gravel may represent flowing water.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Arts &amp; Crafts:&nbsp;</strong>Kyoto is Japan&#39;s heart and soul, a great centre for the arts for over a millennium. It was also the eastern terminus of the old Silk Road and the final repository for a continent&#39;s worth of cultural influences. Japan has at times looked outward and at times looked inwards, drawing inspiration from the world and then refining it to the nth degree. The result is a rich, sophisticated artistic tradition that transcends museum walls and seeps into daily life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Tea Ceremony:&nbsp;</strong><em>Chanoyu</em>&nbsp;(literally &#39;water for tea&#39;) is usually translated as &#39;tea ceremony&#39;, but it&#39;s more like performance art, with each element &ndash; from the gestures of the host to the feel of the tea bowl in your hand &ndash; carefully designed to articulate an aesthetic experience. It&#39;s had a profound and lasting influence on the arts in Japan; whether you take part in a ceremony or simply pause to admire a teahouse,&nbsp;<em>sad\u014d</em>&nbsp;(the way of tea) will colour your Kyoto experience.</p>",

It is only 100 kilometers (62 miles) from Tokyo, Japan&#39;s&nbsp;capital&nbsp;and largest&nbsp;city.

You&rsquo;ll find yourself gawping at the mesmerising views of the coast the higher you climb.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Arles</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>On the cusp of the Camargue National Park in the Provence-Alpes-C&ocirc;te d&rsquo;Azur region, Arles is a heady blast of Van Gogh nostalgia &ndash; the artist painted in excess of 200 works around this lovely Roman town. The stately amphitheatre, one of the largest in Roman times, is part of the reason for Arles&rsquo; Unesco World Heritage Site status. The twisting aluminium tower designed by Frank Gehry brings the city&rsquo;s architecture bang up to date: one more reason to come see the place for yourself.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Bandol</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>In a sheltered bay backed by hills, this former fishing port has long attracted visitors, notably writers Katherine Mansfield and Thomas Mann. Today it&rsquo;s popular with French holidaymakers from Marseille and nearby Toulon, as well as tourists in love with its sunny, sandy beaches. If you would prefer a little privacy, head to the smaller rocky bays and creeks along the coastal path. In town, stroll the palm-tree lined harbour, licking a scoop of refreshing lavender ice cream; sample the renowned local wine, particularly the red, cultivated in the surrounding sun-ripened vineyards; and enjoy the relaxed, Mediterranean pace of life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>and many more...............</p>",

Together with Eiffel and a French architect, Stephen Sauvestre, the engineers submitted their plans to a contest that would determine the centerpiece for the 1889 World&#39;s Fair in Paris.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Eiffel company&#39;s design won, and construction of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.livescience.com/29263-iron.html\">wrought-iron tower</a>&nbsp;began in July 1887. But not everyone in Paris was thrilled with the idea of a giant metal monument looming over the city.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even to contemporary eyes, the Eiffel Tower is unique. But in the late 19th century, nothing had been seen like it. &quot;Modern architecture was emerging slightly in Paris before the Eiffel Tower. But it was doing it in a very shy way,&quot; said Gudek Snajdar. Iron, which was newly popular as a building material because of the Industrial Revolution, became a cornerstone of modern architecture. But in 1887, it had only appeared internally, as support structures, or in unimportant buildings like hothouses, factories and bridges.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The biggest problem was that they still didn&#39;t know how to make something aesthetically appealing with the new material. When they were using it, they would try to repeat historic stone structures. It&#39;s very visible on &mdash; for example, pillars in the Bibliotheque Ste.-Genevieve in Paris,&quot; explained Gudek Snajdar. &quot;However, with the Eiffel Tower they changed completely the way they were using the new material. The structure, its appearance is completely new and modern.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When construction of the tower began on the Champs de Mars, a group of 300 artists, sculptors, writers and architects sent a petition to the commissioner of the Paris Exposition, pleading him to halt construction of the &quot;ridiculous tower&quot; that would dominate Paris like a &quot;gigantic black smokestack.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the protests of Paris&#39; artistic community fell on deaf ears. Construction of the tower was completed in just over two years, on March 31, 1889.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

One explanation is the sense of mystery. The identity of the sitter is unclear. The woman portrayed is thought to be Lisa Gherardini, the wife of a Florentine merchant named Francesco del Giocondo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another explanation for the painting&#39;s celebrity is the subject&#39;s enigmatic smile, possibly symbolizing the ideal of happiness. Her captivating expression and sidewards glance have a way of enchanting viewers. Observers notice how the Mona Lisa appears to be watching them from wherever they stand in the room.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many visitors come to the Louvre just to see this one painting, certainly the museum&#39;s most famous work of art. Created by Leonardo da Vinci around 1503, the small painting is covered with an extra layer of plexiglass and is usually surrounded by a crowd of tourists trying to a get a glimpse of it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Les Noces de Cana by Paolo Veronese (Denon Wing, Room 711)<br />\r\nVeronese created this remarkable painting in 1563, commissioned by the Benedictine San Giorgio Maggiore Monastery in Venice. The immense 70-square-meter painting covers an entire wall of the Louvre gallery from floor to ceiling; originally it was intended to decorate the refectory of the monastery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Les Noces de Cana (The Wedding Feast at Cana) is a masterful composition that portrays the biblical wedding scene at Cana in the Galilee, the event according to John the Apostle when Christ performs the miracle of turning water into wine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The remarkable composition of more than 100 figures somehow manages to look harmonious rather than crowded. The bride and groom are seated at the end of the banquet table on the left hand side. Christ is at the center surrounded by his disciples. Contemporary Venetians mingle with biblical personages in Oriental turbans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The artist&#39;s astounding attention to detail is seen in the realistic minutia, such as the draping of the splendid Venetian costumes. The action-packed scene is full of surprises: a dwarf holding a parakeet (lower lefthand side), little birds, friendly dogs, and an amusing cat (lower righthand side) that seems to be an uninvited guest as it scratches its claws on a water pitcher</p>\r\n\r\n<p>V&eacute;nus de Milo (Sully Wing, Room 346)<br />\r\nThe V&eacute;nus de Milo is one of the highlights of the Louvre&#39;s antiquities department. This alluring statue, also known as Aphrodite, represents the Greek ideal of beauty. Created around 100 BC, the goddess statue reflects the stylization of the late Hellenistic Period. The work has mesmerized the art world ever since it was discovered on Greece&#39;s Island of Milos (&quot;Melos&quot; in ancient Greek) in 1820 and was presented to King Louis XVIII.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What makes this statue a masterwork is the balanced composition, the sense of space, and the way the drapery falls over the goddess&#39; hips. Unfortunately the missing pieces of marble make it difficult to fully identify and understand the statue. Art historians have tried to imagine how her arms were positioned and where she might have been standing. Some believe that she may have held an apple, a crown, or a shield. Another hypothesis is that Venus held a mirror in one hand to admire her reflection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Victoire de Samothrace (Denon Wing, Room 703)<br />\r\nA masterpiece of Hellenistic art, this monumental classical sculpture is breathtaking to behold. Presented in its own space at the top of a grand staircase, the Victoire de Samothrace (Winged Victory) has a way of captivating visitors when they turn the corner and catch a glimpse of the statue.<br />\r\nCreated around 190 BC, the winged Goddess of Victory was found on the island of Samothrace and is thought to be a religious offering by the people of Rhodes in commemoration of naval victory. Perched in a courageous stance on the prow of a ship, the winged Goddess of Victory (Nike) leads a vessel sailing through heady gusts of wind.<br />\r\nThe figure of the Goddess is portrayed so accurately that one can hardly believe it was crafted 2,000 years before photography and 3D graphic modeling. The spiraling composition creates the effect of vigorous movement, with the wings held back and the right leg placed in front of the left. The Goddess appears to be drenched in water, as her transparent clothing clings to her body, revealing the shape of the nude female body. At the same time, a breeze causes the goddess&#39; draped clothing to billow, which gives the sculpture a stunning sense of realism.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>",
        "Reasons_to_visit": "<p>1. The Louvre is a landmark in itself. I can already guarantee it has made an appearance on your instagram feed at some point. It&#39;s iconic entrance, a pyramid made entirely of glass, was completed in 1989 and is by far its most identifiable feature.<br />\r\n2. The Louvre is one of the worlds largest museums with over 15,000 visitors a day. On the right bank of the Seine it, to this day, remains one of the worlds most visited museums. There must be something about it right?<br />\r\n3. The actual Louvre is incredible in size. The pyramid itself is only the entrance, the building surrounding it, known as the Grand Palace, extends itself to the rest of the museum. Inside is no different, finding myself in one of the many wings was proof of this. After looking out the window at one point I realised I was across the road from where I first thought I was.<br />\r\n4. One of the most famous greek sculptures to exist can be found in the Louvre. The Venus de Milo, said to depict Aphrodite, the greek goddess of love and beauty, &nbsp;remains on permanent display. How many of your acquaintances can say they have ever come face to face with this incredible piece of history in their lifetime?<br />\r\n5. The pieces found in the Louvre are endless. From Egyptians, to Greeks to Romans (to name a few), the time periods this one museum covers are beyond belief. Even for someone like myself, who favours one time period of study to the other, I desired to explore them all<br />\r\n6. This famous building really was a palace. It was originally built as a fortress by Phillip II (12c.) and it wasn&#39;t until 1682 that Louis XIV relocated his official housing to the Palace of Versailles located just outside of Paris. The Louvre after this was used to display the royal collection and then officially became a museum during the French Revolution as decided by the National Assembly.&nbsp;<br />\r\n7. The Louvre is home to Leonardo Da Vinci&#39;s Mona Lisa, the most famous painting in the world. Most iconic about this painting is the facial expression, a frown or a smile? No one knows for sure. Whilst it attracted little attention in its early days it wasn&#39;t until it was stolen in 1911 that it really rose to prominence. After being retrieved two years later it has since received extensive security (including bulletproof glass). The painting itself is described as a &#39;priceless&#39; but many have estimated its value is beyond $700 million. Did I mention when I visited it had five staff/security members guarding it?<br />\r\n8. The many many paintings are impeccable and well preserved. It is extraordinary to see pieces of such importance perfectly positioned and in almost perfect condition. The inside of the Louvre is like nothing you have ever seen before. From glorious ceiling paintings, to gold sculptures this museum falls nothing short of grand and certainly compliments the history that it displays.<br />\r\n9. It is the perfect place to people watch. The Louvre attracts visitors from around the globe incorporating the past, present and many different cultures all within one location. Whether you are walking around the museums grounds or dining at Caf&eacute; Marly there is just something about the Louvre that screams perfection. It really is one of Paris&#39; the worlds finest.<br />\r\n10. Carrousel Du Louvre. Unexpectedly I was greeted with not only an Apple shop, alongside a department store containing an array of my favourite designers, but even a Starbucks. If museums aren&#39;t your thing i&#39;m sure the thought of shopping will make your visit all the more pleasurable. &nbsp;</p>",

The Grand Palace</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Palace has been listed for 30 years as a World Heritage and is considered one of the greatest achievements in French 17th century art. What used to be Louis XIII&#39;s old hunting pavilion was transformed and continued to be embellished by France&#39;s succeeding kings. Starting from his son, Louis XIV, who installed the Court and government within the pavilion in 1682. At present, the palace contains 2,300 rooms and its area expands to up to 63,154 square meters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2.&nbsp;The Estate of Trianon</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When the Royals needed a break from the prying eyes and ears of the public they sought refuge in the Estate Trianon. Although its construction began under Louis XIV, it&#39;s more famously for Queen Marie-Antoinette. She was known to regularly visit the Petit Trianon, where she had beautifully landscaped gardens commissioned creating a rustic atmosphere for intimate moments. Here you&#39;ll be able to see many of the estate&#39;s architectural gems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3.&nbsp;The Royal Stables</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Construction of the Great and Small stables was built under Louis XIV rule and is considered the greatest royal construction project for housing horses ever. Situated across the Palace, both stable stand at the edge of Place d&rsquo;Armes. The placement and size of the Royal Stables is a testament to the importance of horses in the Ancien R&eacute;gime.</p>",

        "Explain_each_feature": "<p>Mont Saint-Michel was conceived in a dream<br />\r\n1. It was 708 A.D. One night, Bishop Aubert of Avranches had a vision. The Archangel Michael, who had defeated Satan in the war in heaven, appeared in a dream and instructed Aubert to build an oratory on the rocky island at the mouth of the Couesnon river.At first, Aubert ignored the vision, until the Archangel burned a hole in his head as a gentle reminder, whispering &ldquo;build it and they will come&rdquo;.And come they did&mdash;pilgrims from all Christendom, and today, tourists from all corners of the world. Aubert&rsquo;s skull is displayed at the Saint-Gervais d&rsquo;Avranches basilica bearing the scar of Michael.<br />\r\nMont Saint-Michel soars 302 ft towards the heavens.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. Mont Saint-Michel is a structural hierarchy of feudal society<br />\r\nOn top, there is God, then the abbey and monastery; below this, the Great halls, then stores and housing, and at the bottom, outside the walls, the fishermen&rsquo;s and farmers&rsquo; housing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3. Mont Saint-Michel was one of the most important pilgrimage destinations<br />\r\nSecond, only to Santiago de Compostela in Spain, Mont-Saint Michel was an important pilgrimage of faith during the Middle Ages.<br />\r\nSuch was the difficulty of the journey that it became a test of penitence, sacrifice, and commitment to God to reach the Benedictine abbey. Chosen by Richard II, Duke of Normandy, the Italian architect, William of Volpiano, &nbsp;designed the Romanesque church of the abbey, daringly placing the transept crossing at the top of the mount.<br />\r\nMany underground crypts and chapels had to be built to compensate for this weight, forming the foundation for the supportive upward structure that we see today. Standing separate, not linking the abbey buildings, the cloister is a place to meditate, with the fragrance of herbs, flowers, and the sea filling the air. Nestled at the foot of the abbey in the main street, the parish church of &Eacute;glise Saint-Pierre (Church of St Peter) is a little gem often overlooked by visitors.<br />\r\nWhen the abbey was secularised in the 19th century, the church became the focus of the pilgrimages to Mont Saint-Michel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4. The English couldn&rsquo;t conquer Mont Saint-Michel<br />\r\nDuring the Hundred Years&rsquo; War, the Kingdom of England made repeated assaults on the island but were unable to seize it due to the abbey&rsquo;s strong fortifications. Besieging Mont in 1423&ndash;24, and then again in 1433&ndash;34, the English forces under the command of Thomas de Scales, 7th Baron Scales abandoned two wrought-iron bombards (cannon) when he gave up his siege. Known as &ldquo;Les Michelettes&rdquo;, they remain on-site to mark the impenetrable fortress protected by God.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>5. Mont Saint-Michel inspired Joan of Arc to victory<br />\r\nWhen news of the island&rsquo;s stand against the English reached a young peasant girl in Orl&eacute;ans, south-west of Paris, the tide would turn against England in the Hundred Years&rsquo; War. That girl was Joan of Arc, and so inspired was she at the story of resistance at Mont St Michel, she would help recapture France from the English.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>6. Mont St Michel has a counterpart in Cornwall, England<br />\r\nIn 1067, the monastery of Mont Saint-Michel gave its support to William the Conqueror in his claim to the throne of England. Rewarding the monastery with properties and grounds on the English side of the Channel, he included a small island off the southwestern coast of Cornwall which was modelled after the Mount and became a Norman priory named St Michael&rsquo;s Mount of Penzance. The two mounts share the same tidal island characteristics and the same conical shape, though St Michael&rsquo;s Mount is much smaller.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>7. Mont Saint-Michel served as a prison<br />\r\nWith its popularity and prestige as a centre of pilgrimage waning during the Reformation, by the time of the French Revolution, there were very few monks in residence.Closed in 1791, the abbey was converted into a prison, initially holding clerical opponents of the republican regime&mdash;up to 300 priests at one point. Nicknamed &ldquo;bastille des Mers&rdquo;, meaning &ldquo;Bastille of the sea&rdquo;, it was named after the fortress in Paris that served as a state prison during the Ancien Regime. Serving as a windlass, a treadwheel crane helped hoist supplies high up to the prison walls. Prisoners would rotate the wheel by walking inside it like hamsters. Treadmill cranes were commonly used for lifting heavy objects on medieval construction sites. After a series of high profile political prisoners were held at Mont Saint-Michel, influential figures, including Victor Hugo, launched a campaign to restore what they felt was a national architectural treasure.Closing the prison in 1863, Napoleon III ordered the 650 prisoners to be transferred to other facilities.</p>",
        "Reasons_to_visit": "<p>8 Reasons To Visit Mont Saint Michel, France</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1.) It is really beautiful during the day<br />\r\nLike, when the sun rises over Mont Saint Michel, it&rsquo;s just so beautiful. Yes, it&rsquo;s perched in northern France, so it&rsquo;s not as warm as the French Riviera, but hey, with views like this you&rsquo;ll forget all about the weather.<br />\r\nBest of all, you can spend the night in places like, the relatively nearby, L&rsquo;Ermitage Mont Saint Michel &ndash; it&rsquo;s so beautiful!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2.) It manages to be even prettier at sunset<br />\r\nOnce the sun begins to dip in the west, Mont Saint Michel gets bathed in a gorgeous orange glow &ndash; that is so gorgeous to see. Stick around the area in the early evening and you&rsquo;ll see what I mean.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3.) The Abbey is beautiful inside<br />\r\nIf you get the chance to explore the abbey, then do it. You won&rsquo;t be disappointed. The whole &lsquo;mont&rsquo; is just too gorgeous not to explore. I personally think 4 hours or so is great (or even a day, if you want to take it slow).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4.) To see enjoy the architecture<br />\r\nThere are not too many places that are as iconic as Mount Saint Michel. It really is unique and a place to enjoy some of the gorgeous buildings and historic landmarks that have been built on this tidal island.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>5.) The streets are quaint and pretty<br />\r\nWhen you arrive at Mount Saint Michel, you&rsquo;ll see what I mean! Just by walking through this gorgeous place, you&rsquo;ll feel like you&rsquo;ve been whisked back in time. Without sounding cheesy, it&rsquo;s magical!&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>6.) No view of Mont Saint Michel&rsquo;s is the same&nbsp;<br />\r\nLike, really! Even for the smallest little place, Mont Saint Michels looks totally different depending on where you stand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>7.) Even if it gets cloudy, it&rsquo;s still beautiful<br />\r\nI haven&rsquo;t visited in the fog, but I&rsquo;ve heard that it looks so dramatic and cool! So make sure you embrace the weather and let Mont Saint Michel charm you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>8.) The fortress style island is totally impressive<br />\r\nThe high and thick walls are bound to leave you utterly impressed (especially when you consider that it is all built on quicksand (though don&rsquo;t worry &ndash; there&rsquo;s a causeway to take you there safely).</p>",

Even with just a day or two to spare, travellers can get a taste of Miami &mdash; and work on their base tan. Those planning a short stay in Miami should look into a tour, or check out our weekend in Miami itinerary.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFor a full submersion into Miami&rsquo;s Cuban culture, travellers should head to Little Havana. The Miami neighbourhood is full of island influence, from its traditional cigar shops to art galleries. One of the easiest ways to get familiar with Little Havana is through a guided tour, and tasting the authentic Cuban food found along Calle Ocho. Little Havana is the centre of Cuban culture in Miami but its influence expands far past the neighbourhood&rsquo;s borders. The Latin language, music, and cuisine can be found all over Magic City.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>",
        "Reasons_to_visit": "<p>Legendary nightlife-The nightlife in Miami is set at sparkly clubs, that are ranked among the world&rsquo;s best places to party. From midnight to morning, they are filled with celebrities, locals, and tourists all with a common interest of bright lights and loud music. Top-tier DJs are booked from Thursday to Sunday, bringing the best sets of hip hop and house to South Beach. Those looking for something more low key will favour the city&rsquo;s luxe lounges and hotel bars.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nExperience the origins of the Art Deco movement-Spend a day on Miami Beach and you&rsquo;ll see the city&rsquo;s Art Deco influence everywhere. In fact, Miami Beach is home to the first 20th-century neighbourhood to be recognized by the National Register of Historic Places, so Art Deco draws in a lot of tourism to Miami. This form of architecture, which dates back to the early &rsquo;20s and &rsquo;30s, is an eye-catching mix of modern, Neoclassical and retro styles.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe heart of nature-Miami puts you in close proximity to Florida&rsquo;s stunning ecosystems. Take a day trip to the Everglades, where airboat rides go right through mangroves and bring tourists close to Florida&rsquo;s famous alligators. Drive through the Florida Keys, which starts just 30 minutes from the southernmost point of Miami and is home to 15 protected marine sanctuaries. In less than two hours you can be on the west coast of Florida, where Lee County Manatee Park has one of the largest concentrations of endangered Florida manatees. Stay on the west coast to paddleboard through the Gulf of Mexico&rsquo;s calm and clear waters, or head back east to snorkel through Biscayne National Park. A picture of South Florida&rsquo;s stunning underwater ecosystems, Biscayne National Park protects over 500 species of reef fish, Neotropical water birds, endangered species and coral reefs.</p>",

The next morning, go on the stunning Narrows Hike. During the summer, you can traverse these wearing whatever you want, but in the winter, a dry suit is the only option &ndash; getting armpit-deep in icy waters is not advisable in a pair of sliders and a flannel shirt. It&rsquo;s not unusual for guided tours to go on for up to five hours, but this is time well spent.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&ldquo;The Greatest Snow on Earth.&rdquo; The high altitude, the dry atmosphere and the salty air make sure the snow is powdery &ndash; &ldquo;champagne powder,&rdquo; as it is known.

By the time you reach Nevada to catch the plane home from Vegas, you&rsquo;ll have covered at least three seasons.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou can discover rich Native American history-Utah is named after the Ute people who, along with the Navajo, occupied the region millennia before any white settlers arrived. The state is packed with plenty of Native history, from remarkable petroglyphs and wondrous rock art to ancient ruins and artefacts. Within the Maze District of Canyonlands National Park, visitors can discover Late-Archaic artwork dating back as far as 9000 BC.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt has a giant playground in the form of an ex-Olympic park-Utah was briefly the focus of the world&rsquo;s sporting press in 2002 when the Winter Olympics came to Salt Lake City. Unlike many ex-Olympic venues, the park is still very much in use. The highlight of the visit has to be the opportunity to bobsled down the original Olympic run &ndash; go on the ice in the winter, and get up to 70mph (113kph), or go on wheels in the warmer months and reach speeds of 80mph (129kph).</p>",

From its city and beach names (which are almost all still in the Hawaiian language) to hula demonstrations at luaus to people speaking Hawaiian at the grocery store, the islands thrive on Hawaiian culture and its survival.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHawaii is home to multiple beautiful animals that thrive near the coastal regions, and they are easy to spot if you keep an eye out for them. Whales put on amazing shows during the winter months, and dolphins swim around the islands year-round. You might even see the endangered honu (green sea turtle) grazing on limu (seaweed) or monk seals lounging on the beaches. It&rsquo;s important, however, to respect Hawaiian laws and wildlife; don&rsquo;t get too close and never touch.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNot many places have clear views of both sunrise and sunsets. In Hawaii, the sun rises in the east and sets in the west, over the water, every day! Please take some time to enjoy both the sunrise and sunset while you are here; it is very cleansing for the soul.</p>",
        "Reasons_to_visit": "<p>It has untouched beauty-Some parts of Hawaii are so beautiful and look the same as they did thousands of years ago. It is quite easy to find a piece of secluded paradise if taking the scenic route, instead of travelling the highways.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe weather-Even though Hawaii has a winter season, it doesn&rsquo;t get much colder than 75&deg;F (24&deg;C) during the day&mdash;ever. It is summer all year long to the typical vacationer, and shorts and bathing suits are normal attire.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Beaches-Hawaii Beaches are some of the most spectacular in the world. Every island is home to a famous beach, with Oahu&rsquo;s Waikiki being one of the most notable. Of course, you can&rsquo;t ignore the beauty of Kauai&rsquo;s North Shore beaches either.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWaterfalls-Some of the most beautiful waterfalls in the world is found in Hawaii. In fact, the Hawaiian Islands&rsquo; waterfalls are one of the best reasons to visit Hawaii. With lush rainforest vegetation, waterfalls in Hawaii remind us of a magical scene from Fern Gully. For the best waterfalls, make sure to include Maui on your itinerary.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHawaii Activities-Surrounded by an endless ocean, the Hawaiian Islands offer world-class surfing, snorkelling, scuba diving, fishing, paddle boarding and more. You can even board a submarine for an underwater cruise or board a yacht for a Na Pali Coast dinner cruise.</p>",

        "Explain_each_feature": "<p>An example of the extraordinary natural beauty of the Bahamas is its famous pink sand beaches. According to researchers, the light pink sand gets its hue from thousands of broken coral pieces, shells, and calcium carbonate materials left behind by foraminifera (tiny marine creatures with red and pink shells) that live in the coral reefs that surround the beach. Harbour Island, one of the 700 islands of the Bahamas, is known to have one of the very best pink sand beaches in the world.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Bahamas is famously known for its beautiful, luxurious beach hotels. The Beach Tower at Atlantis, Paradise Island, Grand Hyatt and Breezes Resort are a few of the most popular hotels. The hotels in the Bahamas have mastered the art of providing world-class service while still making their guests feel at home. Great facilities, hotel activities and the standard of accommodation are other reasons why Bahamian hotels are top-notch.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Bahamas offer the striking crystal waters that one might associate with the Caribbean, despite these islands being only about an hour from Miami and therefore planted squarely in the Atlantic. These waters may actually be some of the clearest in the world, so it&rsquo;s no wonder it&rsquo;s a popular destination for snorkelers and scuba divers. Perhaps even more beautiful than the water itself is what lies therein: The Bahamas are full of colourful marine life and an assortment of shipwrecks just waiting to be explored.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPowdery, light sand can be found around most of the many, many Bahamian islands; some of them are secluded and remote, while others are adjacent to luxury resorts, so there&rsquo;s bound to be a beach that suits everyone&rsquo;s vacation desires. Relax on a beach alone to drop out, or plant yourself among other vacationers with a drink in your hand&mdash;there are plenty of beach options for both.</p>",
        "Reasons_to_visit": "<p>Delicious Bahamian food-Bahamian food is an eclectic combination of southern American (think cornbread, peas, and rice) and Caribbean (think spicy seafood) styles. Conch, a plentiful shellfish, is the island&rsquo;s national food, and many Bahamians have mastered making a variety of conch dishes such as conch soup, conch fritters and conch pizza. All inhabited islands of the Bahamas have an impressive choice of upscale restaurants, eateries and caf&eacute;s to choose from.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSoak up the sun-There is no bad time to visit the Bahamas. The weather is great year-round and remains relatively consistent, with temperatures rarely dipping below 60 degrees, even in wintertime. Even though there is a rainy season from May to June, the rains are rarely continuous. The island still remains fairly warm, making it the perfect place to soak up some sun and relax.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGo snorkelling and scuba diving-With crystal-clear water and a variety of marine life, reefs and shipwrecks, the Bahamas is one of the world&rsquo;s premier destinations for scuba diving and snorkelling. All the scuba companies are approved and monitored by the Bahamas Diving Association, so you&rsquo;re guaranteed to deal with a safe and secure firm while exploring Bahamian waters.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGo the island-hopping-The Bahamas is an archipelago consisting of about 700 islands. Of that 700, 30 of those islands are inhabited, which makes the Bahamas the perfect place to go island-hopping. Nassau is the capital of the Bahamas and is a popular destination for those travelling to the island. From Nassau, you can easily travel to the small islands, each of which has its own unique features. A boat or ferry is the usual means of transportation, as they are inexpensive, but there are also flights from Nassau to the smaller islands.</p>",

In the year 1975, the Department of Wildlife of Sri Lanka set up its present home: Pinnawala (Pinnawela) Elephant Orphanage at Pinnawala, Kegalle.

This is a must-see sight in Bangkok as the architectural design is completely unique to that of the other temples in Thailand&rsquo;s capital. The spire which sits directly on the river bank is covered from top to bottom with minute pieces of coloured glass and Chinese porcelain. And for the brave at heart, one can even climb this steep 70-metre high spire which boasts the best views of Bangkok&rsquo;s skyline. Although named the Temple of Dawn, Wat Arun is best at night when lit up as it gives off a golden beam of light over the Chao Phraya River.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis is one sight you won&rsquo;t see anywhere else other than in Southeast Asia. Picture this &ndash; anchored on either side of the river, boats stocked to the brim with fresh tropical fruit and veggies, coconut juice, and local food which has been lovingly tendered on open grills. The best way to go about exploring Bangkok&rsquo;s floating markets is to hop aboard one of the many guided boat tours on offer. The 3 most popular floating markets in Bangkok are Damnoen Saduak, Amphawa, and Klong Lat Mayom with Damnoen Saduak being the most popular floating market in the country.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBuilt-in 1782 and once the home of the Thai King, the royal court and the administrative seat of government, Bangkok&rsquo;s Grand Palace is the most glorified and world-renowned landmark in the capital. Here all you architectural and culture junkies can lose yourselves in the ancient designs of the diverse array of Buddhist sculptures and temples that flow through the vicinity. Most popular amongst tourists has to be Wat Phra Kaew, in English the &ldquo;Temple of the Emerald Buddha&rdquo;. The 14th century Emerald Buddha, revered by all Thais, is a highlight too.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis is the tallest building in Thailand. The 88-story building gazes out over the entire Bangkok skyline with mesmerising views reaching out over the horizon. The cylinder-shaped structure does not only cater for those looking for luxurious accommodation but also for outsiders looking for a once in a lifetime setting to quench one&rsquo;s thirst in the country&rsquo;s highest bar &ndash; the aptly named Sky Bar. The tip of the iceberg though is the 360-degree rotating viewpoint right at the very top of the building. In exchange for the cover charge, you receive a free drinks voucher and the best position to sip and see in the capital.</p>",
        "Reasons_to_visit": "<p>The Cheap Cost of Travel-Travelers on a budget are constantly and regretfully having to slash cities from their itineraries due to a sheer lack of funds. This is not the case in Thailand, however, where travel is cheap and different modes of transportation are readily available. Budget-friendly airlines, like Nok Air and AirAsia, always seem to be running some type of sale on flights, with direct flights available to international and domestic airports in cities across the country. Buses and trains around the country are incredibly affordable as well, with stations in both rural cities and some of the biggest tourist destinations in Thailand.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Nightlife-Thailand is eager to please those visitors who thrive after dark. Get ready night owls, as the country is equipped with every type of nightlife tourists could possibly imagine. Backpackers head to Khao San Road to connect with like-minded travellers and buckets upon buckets of booze. Those with seedier intentions beeline for one of the many red-light districts found in cities across the country, including Bangkok, Pattaya, Phuket, and more. Though these are some of the main draws that entice those looking for a good night out, the country is also renowned for its reggae and jazz bars in addition to having some of the best LGBTQ-friendly nightlife in the world, especially in Bangkok.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Temples-With over 40,000 Buddhist temples found across the Land of Smiles, visitors are surely bound to find at least one that catches their eye. These structures date back to all of the different dynasties, each one reflecting that era&rsquo;s architectural and construction style. Each province is bound to have at least one of these majestic wonders, though the most unique and abundant are found in the capital.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Capital-Bangkok gets a section all its own, as the capital is hands down one of the main reasons to visit the country. Over eight million people reside in the city, many of whom are ex-pats. It seems as though once someone visits the capital long enough, they never want to leave. Bangkok is often the first stop on traveller&rsquo;s itineraries before heading to Southeast Asia, and it is usually not their favourite city. The capital is crowded and can be overwhelming, leaving many traveller&#39;s less than impressed. Those who get off the beaten path, however, will find Bangkok is a city full of surprises, with seemingly every top thing to see and do available. Temples, red-light districts, sky bars, museums, art galleries, parks: you name it, the city is sure to have it.</p>",

        "Reasons_to_visit": "<p>To visit its stunning chateaux<br />\r\nThe Loire Valley has been the chosen retreat of the French elite for hundreds of years. Its popularity with aristocracy and royalty has left its lush countryside sprinkled with fairytale chateaux and many grand Renaissance-era castles that tourists can visit. There are 22 in the Grands Sites du Val de Loire (Major Sites of the Loire Valley) collective, but there are many smaller, less well-known chateaux worth visiting too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To surround yourself with sunflowers<br />\r\nDriving through the Loire Valley in summer is a pleasure&mdash;not only are roads nearly empty but there are also thousands of sunflowers. The glowing yellow fields are at their most photogenic in the morning and make the perfect selfie backdrop.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To explore its thriving markets<br />\r\nMarkets are a way of life in France, and the Loire Valley is no exception. Many of the biggest towns hold events every day. In addition to the standard fresh food markets, markets also sell everything from second-hand books and vintage furniture to truffles and flowers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To visit a vineyard&hellip;or two<br />\r\nThe Loire Valley is famous for its world-class wines. The Valley is laced with vineyards all the way from Sancerre to the ocean, and it offers wines ranging from to suit every palate from sparkling vouvrays to vibrant Sancerres. Lots of vineyards offer public tours of their vines and cellars as well as tastings. Visit the Ch&acirc;teau de Brissac. The enormous seven-story chateau produces a delicious ros&eacute; that tour-goers get to taste at the end of their tour.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To delve into its dwellings<br />\r\nHiding beneath the rolling hills are a network of tunnels and caves and see the stalactites, statues, and abandoned ancient villages.<br />\r\nMuch of the gleaming white limestone gracing the area&rsquo;s chateaux comes from the Saumur area. This excessive quarrying resulted in lots of hollow limestone caves which have been ingeniously turned into houses and businesses. Head to Rochemenier to see a prime example of a troglodytic village including a 13th-century chapel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To spend time along the Loire<br />\r\nNot only is the Loire the longest river in France, but it is also a haven for wildlife and boasts some of France&rsquo;s most breathtaking scenery. There are many ways to have fun with the river: enjoy it on a boat trip from Nantes, have a paddle at Ingrandes, or simply admire it from afar from one of the many chateaux that line its banks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To discover its historic towns and cities<br />\r\nWith their buzzy caf&eacute;s, thriving markets, and aromas of freshly baked bread and patisseries wafting through, it is the cobbled towns and ancient cities that make the Loire so special. The best thing to do is drive&mdash;surrounded by all of those sunflowers, it&rsquo;s hardly a chore. Alternatively, families will enjoy motoring along Briare&rsquo;s unique 19th-century canal aqueduct while equestrian fans should head to Saumur&rsquo;s National Riding School. History buffs are spoiled for choice thanks to medieval towns and historic chateaux at every turn. For something different, head to Gien to see its 14th-century ramparts or to Vend&ocirc;me to see its pristine parks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To admire its pristine gardens<br />\r\nThe Loire Valley is known as the Garden of France for a reason. Many of the towns and cities boast fantastic parks, but green-fingered visitors should make sure they check out the countless botanical gardens and chateaux estates. Visit Villandry if nowhere else and don&rsquo;t overlook its famous vegetable garden that features vivid blue leeks, shiny purple cabbages, and jade carrot tufts.</p>",

The&nbsp;<strong>UNESCO-listed</strong>&nbsp;cathedral exemplifies the glory of medieval Gothic architecture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Chartres Cathedral is renowned for its marvelous stained-glass windows, most dating to the 13th century.

Other highlights are the&nbsp;<em>Passion</em>&nbsp;window, one of the most original in its style and expression, and the&nbsp;<em>Blue Virgin</em>&nbsp;window that dates from the 12th century.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From April through October, the city of Chartres hosts a Festival of Lights (<strong>Chartres en Lumi&egrave;res</strong>). This free public event includes spectacular evening light shows, illuminating the cathedral and over 20 other monuments in the city. The cathedral is enlivened by multicolor scenes that resemble the monument&#39;s medieval-era painted facade. The light shows are accompanied by music for a truly dazzling presentation.</p>",

Generally ranked as one of the three chief examples of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/art/Western-architecture/Iberia#ref47334\">Gothic</a>&nbsp;French architecture (along with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/Amiens-Cathedral\">Amiens Cathedral</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/Reims-Cathedral\">Reims Cathedral</a>), it is noted not only for its architectural&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/innovations\">innovations</a>&nbsp;but also for its numerous sculptures and its much-celebrated&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/art/stained-glass\">stained glass</a>. The cathedral&rsquo;s association with the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Mary-mother-of-Jesus\">Virgin Mary</a>&nbsp;(the supposed veil of the Virgin is kept in the cathedral treasury) made it the destination of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/pilgrimage-religion\">pilgrims</a>&nbsp;in the Middle Ages, many of them invalids seeking a cure for their&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/afflictions\">afflictions</a>. It continues to be a pilgrimage site for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/Roman-Catholicism\">Roman Catholics</a>&nbsp;in the 21st century.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The oldest parts of the cathedral are its&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/technology/crypt\">crypt</a>&nbsp;and the west portal, or Royal Portal, which are remnants of a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/art/Romanesque-art\">Romanesque</a>&nbsp;church that was mostly destroyed by fire in 1194. The present cathedral was constructed on the foundations of the earlier church and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/consecrated\">consecrated</a>&nbsp;in 1260. It is built of limestone and stands some 112 feet (34 metres) high and is 427 feet (130 metres) long. In many ways, the cathedral&rsquo;s design resembles those of its contemporaries, especially&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/place/Laon-France\">Laon Cathedral</a>, but it displays innovations with its tall&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/technology/arcade\">arcades</a>, unusually narrow&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/technology/triforium\">triforium</a>, and huge&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/technology/clerestory\">clerestory</a>&mdash;the massive weight of which required using flying&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/technology/buttress-architecture\">buttresses</a>&nbsp;in an unprecedented manner.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The cathedral contains an immense amount of sculpture, particularly figure sculpture, ranging from large column statues to miniatures. As the purpose of the sculptures was to preach and instruct, they mainly depict scenes and figures from the Old and New Testaments. The sculptures from the Royal Portal were executed about mid-12th century and reveal the Gothic era&rsquo;s growing interest in naturalism. This is evident in the kings and queens that decorate the jambs. Their bodies are elongated, echoing the form of the columns to which they are attached, yet they have&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/benevolent\">benevolent</a>&nbsp;expressions distinct from the neutral gaze of Romanesque figures. Meanwhile, the sculptures of the south transept, constructed after 1194, are even more expressive. The figures of saints that decorate the jambs of the right doorway (Porch of the Confessors, c. 1220&ndash;30) have individual facial features that sometimes communicate with their neighbours. Notably, Saint Theodore (from the Porch of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Martyrs\">Martyrs</a>, c. 1230) is more fully in the round, practically detached from the architecture, and more&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/dynamic\">dynamic</a>, with swaying hips and shoulders that recall the contrapposto pose that ancient Greek sculptors had perfected.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chartres Cathedral contains 176&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/art/stained-glass\">stained-glass</a>&nbsp;windows, the feature for which it may be best known. Like the sculpture, the stained glass was intended to be educational. The five windows of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/choir-church-architecture\">choir</a>&nbsp;hemicycle (a semicircular arrangement) relate in various ways to the Virgin Mary. The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/technology/rose-window\">rose window</a>&nbsp;in the north transept portrays figures from the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/Old-Testament\">Old Testament</a>. The south&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/technology/transept\">transept</a>, which is representative of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/New-Testament\">New Testament</a>, has a rose window depicting the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Apocalypse\">Apocalypse</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Several alterations have been made to the cathedral. The northwest tower&rsquo;s distinctive spire, for example, was added in the early 1500s. Chartres emerged with relatively little damage from the political and religious upheavals of the 16th century and sustained less damage than most cathedrals during the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/place/France/The-French-Revolution-and-Napoleon-1789-1815#ref40394\">French Revolution</a>&nbsp;(1787&ndash;99). After a fire damaged the roof in 1836, a series of restorations were carried out during the 19th century. In 1979 Chartres Cathedral has designated a UNESCO&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/World-Heritage-site\">World Heritage site</a>. During the late 20th-century preservation efforts concentrated on protecting the cathedral&rsquo;s stained glass from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/science/air-pollution\">air pollution</a>&nbsp;damage, and the interior underwent a controversial cleaning and restoration in the early decades of the 21st century.</p>",

Adding to the charm, the village has pleasant public squares adorned with fountains.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The main street of the village, the rue du G&eacute;n&eacute;ral-de-Gaulle, is a lovely place for a leisurely stroll. The rue du G&eacute;n&eacute;ral-de-Gaulle ends at the Dolder gate tower, which was built in 1291 and now houses a museum.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For such a tiny village, there are plenty of caf&eacute;s, bakeries, boutiques, and restaurants that appeal to the many tourists who visit throughout the year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n3. Obernai</p>\r\n\r\n<p>About 25 kilometers south of Strasbourg, this Free Imperial City of the Holy Roman Empire has retained its medieval ambience, seen in the 13th-century tower, old town gates, narrow pedestrian lanes, and characteristic burghers&#39; houses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Place du March&eacute; (Market Square) features Gothic and Renaissance houses, which lend an elegant air. On this picturesque cobblestone square stands the H&ocirc;tel de Ville (Town Hall), which dazzles onlookers with its ornate Neo-Renaissance facade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A short walk away from the Place du March&eacute; is the Office of Tourism on the Place Beffroi, which occupies a quaint half-timbered house bedecked with potted flowers. Nearby, in front of the H&ocirc;tel de la Cloche, is one of the most scenic spots in Obernai, the Puits aux Six Seaux (Six-Bucket Well), which dates to 1579.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tourists can walk a few blocks from the Puits aux Six Seaux to the Place de l&#39;&Eacute;toile, a lovely square with angular half-timbered houses and storks&#39; nests on the roofs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the best times of year to visit Obernai is during the holiday season. Visitors will enjoy the convivial spirit of the town&#39;s quintessentially Alsatian Christmas celebration. A magnificent Christmas tree and magical illuminations decorate the town, while a festive March&eacute; de No&euml;l (Christmas Market) brings together artisan vendors that sell authentic locally made crafts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n4. Kaysersberg</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ruins of an Old Imperial Castle provide a reminder of Kaysersberg&#39;s illustrious past as a Free Imperial City. With remnants of medieval walls, a Romanesque church (the Eglise Sainte-Croix), historic half-timbered houses, and Renaissance burghers&#39; mansions, Kaysersberg has an appealing old-world ambience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For those who want to experience the magic of Christmastime in Alsace, Kaysersberg should be at the top of a tour itinerary in December. Festive illuminations and old-fashioned holiday decor give the town an enchanting ambience during the season, which begins around November 25th and continues until the New Year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The town&#39;s March&eacute; de No&euml;l (Christmas Market) draws many revelers because of its authentic decor and joyous atmosphere. Holiday shoppers appreciate the artisanal market, which features an assortment of craft vendors selling handmade items such as ceramics, jewelry, Christmas tree decorations, gingerbread, fruit jams, kougelhopf, and other seasonal specialties.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n5. Ribeauvill&eacute;<br />\r\nThis pretty little village (only four kilometers from Riquewihr) literally blossoms with quaintness. During springtime and summer, potted flowers adorn the window sills of fetching historic houses, as well as public spaces such as fountains and statues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thanks to these exceptional floral displays, Ribeauvill&eacute; has been awarded the title of four-star &quot;Village Fleuri&quot; - the highest rating. The village&#39;s enchantment is further revealed in its atmospheric cobblestone streets and small squares.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To experience the medieval heritage of Ribeauvill&eacute;, tourists should arrive for Pfifferdaj (the Fiddlers&#39; Festival) in September. During the Middle Ages, Ribeauvill&eacute; was ruled by the Count of Ribeaupierre, known as the &quot;King&quot; of the region&#39;s traveling musicians, who paid dues to him for his protection and gathered annually at Ribeauvill&eacute; for a minstrels&#39; festival (&quot;Pfifferdaj,&quot; which is still celebrated every year on the first Sunday in September).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The medieval-themed festivities continue in Ribeauvill&eacute; with the Medieval Christmas Market. Visitors are immersed in the magic of an old-fashioned Alsatian Christmas celebration, complete with market stalls that sell holiday decorations, artisanal items, and gourmet delicacies of the Middle Ages. Troubadours (singers, clowns, dancers) entertain the crowds, adding to the authentic ambience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other cultural events include the Kougelhopf Festival in early May (devoted to the special cake made with raisons and almonds) and the Festival de Musique Ancienne that presents a program of music concerts (focused on medieval, Renaissance, and Baroque music) from mid-September through October.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>6. Eguisheim<br />\r\nThe typical Alsatian village of Eguisheim (five kilometers from Colmar) is nestled in a sunny valley surrounded by the vine-covered foothills of the Vosges Mountains.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because of its beauty and charm, the village has earned many distinctions: It&#39;s one of France&#39;s &quot;Plus Beaux Villages,&quot; as well as a winner of the &quot;Grand Prix National du Fleurissement,&quot; France&#39;s most prestigious national floral award, and was voted the &quot;village pr&eacute;f&eacute;r&eacute; des Fran&ccedil;ais&quot; (favorite village in France) in 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The village is a cluster of enchanting cobblestone lanes that wind around in a concentric pattern, giving the feel of being in a fairy-tale world. Brightly painted half-timbered houses dating from the 16th and 17th century feature decorative windowsills bursting with colorful potted flowers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eguisheim&#39;s captivating ambience makes it one of Alsace&#39;s top destinations for Christmas. The village celebrates the season with a festive March&eacute; de No&euml;l (Christmas Market) in the Alsatian tradition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n7. S&eacute;lestat<br />\r\nS&eacute;lestat boasts a rich cultural heritage, beginning as a Carolingian stronghold in the 8th century and then as a Free Imperial City of the Holy Roman Empire. The town is just a 35-minute drive (50 kilometers) from Strasbourg.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The city became a center of humanism in the 15th and 16th centuries and today is recognized as a &quot;Ville d&#39;Art et d&#39;Histoire&quot; (City of Art and History). As a testimony to its rich cultural heritage, S&eacute;lestat has a library founded in 1452, which possesses thousands of valuable manuscripts dating from the 7th to the 16th centuries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the center of the town is the 18th-century Neoclassical H&ocirc;tel de Ville (Town Hall), and nearby are two outstanding churches: the three-towered Romanesque Eglise Sainte-Foy and the 13th-century Eglise Saint-Georges, featuring modern stained-glass windows by Max Ingrand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the most amusing things to do in S&eacute;lestat is visit the Maison du Pain d&#39;Alsace, a museum and working bakery dedicated to the art and techniques of Alsatian baking. Visitors can watch the bakers create local specialities (and later sample some at the coffeeshop) such as pretzels, kougelhopf, brioche, bredele (Christmas cookies), and a wide variety of breads.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n8. Vall&eacute;e de Munster<br />\r\nFamous for its cheese, the Valley of Munster is a great starting point to explore the &quot;Route du Fromage&quot; (Cheese Trail). Visitors can begin this gourmet experience by sampling cheeses at the Maison du Fromage (a museum devoted to cheese) and at farmhouse inns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gastronomes will appreciate the region&#39;s cozy restaurants, which specialize in the regional cuisine (renowned for its hearty dishes). Local specialties include Fleischkiechles (ground meat patties), Baeckeoffe (meat stew topped with sliced potatoes), trout in a special sauce, and Tartes Flamb&eacute;es (Alsatian-style pizza made with cream and Emmental cheese).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Traditional markets are a hallmark of the region&#39;s authentic cuisine. An outdoor market takes place at the Place du March&eacute; in Munster on Tuesday and Saturday mornings. In the town of Muhlbach-sur-Munster (five kilometers from Munster), vendors come to the March&eacute; du Terroir (Market of the Terroir) on Sunday mornings at the Place du Weier to sell bread, cheese, and other produits du terroir (regional food products).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For those exploring the Alsace region, the M&uuml;nster Valley is an excellent base for taking excursions to the villages around the Vosges Mountains such as Eguisheim (20 kilometers away), Hattstatt (25 kilometers away), and Rouffach (30 kilometers away). The cities of Turckheim and Colmar are both within a 30-minute drive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>9. Dambach-la-Ville<br />\r\nThis medieval walled town is surrounded by a dreamy landscape of vine-covered, rolling hills. The gorgeous natural backdrop is the perfect juxtaposition for the town&#39;s brightly painted half-timbered houses. Visitors will enjoy discovering the beauty of Dambach-la-Ville, while wandering through a maze of winding cobblestone streets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To continue the scenic strolls, travelers need only venture just outside Dambach-la-Ville, where there are many hiking trails through the countryside.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other excursions include the nearby village of Epfig (eight kilometers away), nestled in an idyllic spot surrounded by vine-covered foothills. The village has a rare Romanesque chapel that dates back to the 11th century, the Chapelle Sainte-Marguerite.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dambach-la-Ville is a delightful place to visit during the F&ecirc;te de la Myrtille (Blueberry Festival) that is held every two years in July. This lively festival attracts crowds, who come to sample the fresh blueberries and handcrafted blueberry pies, tarts, and juices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another festive occasion is the March&eacute; de No&euml;l every year in early December, which brings Christmas spirit to the town with live music concerts and an old-fashioned artisanal market. At dozens of stalls set up outside at the Place du March&eacute; and inside at the Town Hall and in the Salle de la Laube, vendors sell unique Christmastime decorations and gift items.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>10. Rosheim<br />\r\nPicturesque vine-covered hills envelope this lovely small town, which has many flower-bedecked half-timbered houses. The surrounding Pays du Mont Sainte-Odile (countryside of Mount Sainte-Odile) features scenic walking and hiking trails that draw many visitors from springtime through autumn.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Only six kilometers from Obernai, this historic town was another Free Imperial City of the Holy Roman Empire. The town&#39;s heritage is revealed in the vestiges of its past: medieval walls with gated towers and one of the finest Romanesque churches in Alsace, the 12th-century Eglise Saint-Pierre-et-Saint-Paul, which is renowned for its ornate sculpted decorations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Equally intriguing, the town has evidence of a Jewish community dating back to 1215. Although the 19th-century Jewish synagogue is now closed, tourists can still appreciate its neo-Romanesque facade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>11. Molsheim<br />\r\nWithin a maze of cobblestone streets, the medieval town of Molsheim boasts wonderfully preserved old houses and historic monuments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Visitors should begin a tour at the town&#39;s Place du March&eacute; (the old market square) and then walk a few blocks to the Place de l&#39;H&ocirc;tel de Ville to see the 16th-century &quot;La Metzig&quot; (Butchers&#39; Guild House). The rez-de-chauss&eacute;e (street level) of La Metzig is now a restaurant that serves authentic Alsatian cuisine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the outskirts of the town is the Eglise des J&eacute;suites built in 1617. This monumental church is one of the finest examples of Jesuit architecture in Alsace.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>12. Turckheim<br />\r\nFound in the verdant M&uuml;nster Valley, just six kilometers from Colmar, Turckheim is layered in history. Visitors enter the town through its medieval gates, relics of the ancient ramparts: the 14th-century Porte de France, the Porte de Munster, and the Porte du Brand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other well-preserved monuments tell more of the city&#39;s story. The Romanesque Eglise Sainte-Anne dates to the 12th century. The 16th-century Corps de Garde was an assembly room used by the town&#39;s guilds, while the 17th-century H&ocirc;tel de Ville (Town Hall) served as the Court of Justice when Turckheim was an Imperial City (from the 14th to 17th centuries).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Turckheim hosts several events throughout the year, such as an Easter celebration and the Trois-Epis car race.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The village is also famous for its March&eacute; de No&euml;l (Christmas festivities, from December 1st to 24th), which include an Advent Calendar ritual at the Town Hall with candle lightings, Christmas carols, and &quot;Wiehnachts Bredele&quot; (Christmas cakes).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A highlight of Christmastime in Turkheim is the Village des Lutins, a Christmas village of tiny houses (shops) created by local artisans, who present their arts and crafts. Every night, holiday gifts and treats such as cupcakes are distributed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>13. Andlau<br />\r\nAndlau is a quaint village in a tranquil valley near the forests of the Vosges foothills, where bears once roamed in abundance. The bear is a symbol of the village and also has a Christian significance in Andlau.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to local legend, a bear indicated to Saint Richard where to build the abbey of Andlau in the 9th century. This explains why bears make an appearance at the Eglise Abbatiale Saints-Pierre-et-Paul. The church crypt is guarded by a bear carved from stone, and a small bear is found in the intricate bas-reliefs on the exterior.<br />\r\nOther whimsical bear sculptures decorate public spaces throughout the town.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>14. Mittelbergheim<br />\r\nAt the foot of Mount Saint Odile in a ravishing landscape of vine-covered fields, Mittelbergheim is one of the &quot;Plus Beaux Villages de France.&quot; This delightful village (three kilometers from Andlau) has a remarkable unity of architectural style, with most buildings dating to the 17th and 18th centuries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mittelbergheim is also renowned for its gastronomy. Many of the village&#39;s traditional restaurants offer specialties of the region, prepared with fresh ingredients from local markets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the period of Advent, the town celebrates the season with an event called &quot;Bredelmarik,&quot; a market devoted to traditional Alsatian Christmas cakes and cookies. The market takes its name from the word &quot;bredele,&quot; which describes a variety of Christmas cookies ranging from vanilla butter cookies and gingerbread to meringues and hazelnut cookies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The countryside surrounding Mittelbergheim is ideal for taking walks. Several trails outside the village afford wonderful views of the idyllic scenery. With its slow-paced country feel, Mittelbergheim is a good place to relax, appreciate nature, and experience the joie de vivre of Alsace.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>15. Guebwiller<br />\r\nThe attractive and cultured town of Guebwiller stands at the foot of the &quot;Grand Ballon,&quot; the highest summit of the Vosges Mountains.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Guebwiller is recognized as a &quot;Ville d&#39;Art et d&#39;Histoire&quot; because of its architectural treasures, including the Romanesque Eglise Saint-L&eacute;ger; the 11th-century Eglise Saint-Michel; and the 14th-century Couvent de Saint Dominique, originally a monastery of the Dominicains de Haute-Alsace, which has been transformed into a performance venue for music concerts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For those who enjoy hiking and other outdoor activities, it&#39;s worth exploring the rural area outside of Guebwiller in the Vosges Mountains. In this pristine countryside, there is a wide selection of hotels and inns that offer an escape to nature.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other nearby attractions include the Renaissance houses in Soultz (four kilometers away) and the Basilique de Thierenbach in Jungholtz (six kilometers away), a lavish Baroque church that is a pilgrimage destination devoted to the Virgin Mary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>16. Bergheim<br />\r\nSheltered by the rolling foothills of the Vosges Mountains, this walled medieval village is one of the few Alsatian towns with its fortifications from the Middle Ages (built in 1311) still completely intact.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tourists will enjoy meandering through the village&#39;s winding lanes; walking along the ramparts; and visiting the Jardin d&#39;Aneth, a medieval garden where berries and medicinal plants are grown.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A tour of the village should also include the Place du March&eacute; to admire the fountain featuring the village&#39;s coat of arms, the Grand Rue lined with handsome flower-bedecked houses, and the Eglise Notre-Dame de l&#39;Assomption (parish church).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>17. Hunawihr<br />\r\nThe beauty and romance of Hunawihr have earned it a place on the list of &quot;Les Plus Beaux Villages de France.&quot; Surrounded by vine-covered hills and woodlands, this winsome country hamlet features quiet streets lined with floral-adorned half-timbered houses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Besides its pastoral charm, Hunawihr has a few unique tourist attractions: the Butterfly Garden, which allows exotic butterflies to flourish in greenhouses that replicate natural habitats; and the Stork Reintroduction Center, which reintroduces native storks into the wild to help this endangered species survive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The village also has a fortified church, the 15th- to 16th-century Eglise Saint-Jacques le Majeure, where villagers took refuge in times of invasion. This monument is a rare example of defensive religious architecture.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>",
        "Reasons_to_visit": "<p>1. Alsatian cities, towns and villages are beautiful<br />\r\nYou may have heard of Strasbourg and its beautiful Petite France neighbourhood; perhaps you&rsquo;re a wine connoisseur and have heard of Colmar, a key location on the Route des Vins which links many quaint towns and villages on the edge of the Vosges and which was also said to be the inspiration for Howl&rsquo;s Moving Castle. Besides these two picturesque towns, there&rsquo;s also Kaysersberg, Riquewihr, Ribeauvill&eacute;, Obernai, Eguisheim (one of Les Plus Beaux Villages de France) the entire Vall&eacute;e de Munster and numerous others. The delightful half-timbered architectural style is something I really miss seeing on a day-to-day basis!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. It has something for everyone<br />\r\nWhether you&rsquo;re a history buff or an art nerd (or anything in between) there&rsquo;s something for you. Alsace is a region steeped in history: from WW1 battlefields and trenches to the only concentration camp on French soil, there&rsquo;s sure to be something for anyone with even the slightest interest in history.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Strasbourg is filled with museums &ndash; I&rsquo;d particularly recommend the Mus&eacute;e Alsacien (a must-see for anyone interested in traditional Alsatian life) and the Mus&eacute;e des Arts D&eacute;coratifs (akin to visiting a stately home, but much less time consuming!) Strasbourg&rsquo;s museums are free to visit on the first Sunday of every month; the same offer also applies to the Cathedral&rsquo;s viewing platform (which offers stunning views across the Alsatian plain towards the Black Forest!).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Colmar is also home to several museums, the Mus&eacute;e Unterlinden being the most well-known; it&rsquo;s currently being redeveloped so at present a selection of the artefacts (including the remarkable Retable d&rsquo;Issenheim) can be viewed at the &Eacute;glise des Dominicains. The Vosges national park is a true hiker&rsquo;s paradise; in the winter months it&rsquo;s also possible to faire du ski (very cheaply!).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3. It&rsquo;s home to unparalleled Christmas markets<br />\r\nWhether you&rsquo;re a festive fanatic or not is neither here nor there; Alsatian Christmas markets are simply the best. In Alsace, Christmas markets are everywhere and each and everyone is magical. Colmar, the region&rsquo;s second-biggest town has five; Strasbourg, the veritable capital of Christmas has over twice that. Smaller towns tend to host Christmas markets on weekends only; the medieval-themed market in Ribeauvill&eacute; is fantastic (though I chose to give the pigs in blankets stuffed with cheese a miss!) In Breitenbach (Haut-Rhin, as opposed to the other town with the same name in Bas-Rhin) the Christmas market is held in a former brewery &ndash; a somewhat unusual setting with a unique atmosphere.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4. The accent is clear and understandable<br />\r\nContrary to what many may believe, I found the Alsatian accent easy to understand. Everyone I encountered spoke clearly and the accent never caused me to completely misunderstand what someone was saying. A clear, comprehendible accent is key to developing your linguistic skills &ndash; after all, if you can&rsquo;t understand a word anyone is saying, you&rsquo;ll potentially be less inclined to make an effort to speak in a foreign language.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>5. The people are friendly<br />\r\nThis is a slightly subjective point, however, I think it&rsquo;s worth mentioning that Alsatians are welcoming and friendly &ndash; and nothing at all like the stereotypical image of French people being slightly standoffish. Lots of my students would wave and say &lsquo;hi&rsquo; when I passed them in the street; one even took me on a tour of the Christmas markets. Although I had times when I felt lonely or isolated, it was never a result of the people. They say it&rsquo;s the people that make the year abroad so memorable and special and I have to agree.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>6. There are fewer English speakers<br />\r\nHead to Paris, and you may struggle to avoid being &lsquo;Englished&rsquo;; in Alsace, particularly in the more rural towns and villages, it&rsquo;s much easier to practise your language skills on the locals. The only time when you may be treated as a tourist is during the Christmas markets &ndash; but even then it&rsquo;s possible to continue practising your French.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>7. It&rsquo;s really easy to get around<br />\r\nThe TER (train express r&eacute;gional) is reliable and efficient: it&rsquo;s approximately thirty minutes on the train between Strasbourg and Colmar, and twenty-five minutes between Colmar and Mulhouse, the region&rsquo;s second-biggest commune. I&rsquo;d recommend getting la carte Tonus Alsace (a regional railcard) if you plan on travelling a lot; it gets you 50% off all regional train fares (on every day of the week, even at peak times) and costs &euro;19 for the year. To give you an idea of the savings made, it cost me &euro;12.60 for a return Colmar-Strasbourg with a railcard vs. &euro;25.20 without.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For towns not served by rail, there are plenty of bus services; you can even take the bus from Colmar to Freiburg (change to a train in Breisach, just across the German border.) For travelling further afield, the region is also served by two airports: Strasbourg (accessible by train from Strasbourg) and the Euroairport Basel-Mulhouse- Freiburg (accessible by bus from St Louis, the nearest station in France.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>8. The cost of living isn&rsquo;t extortionate<br />\r\nCompared to Paris or the popular C&ocirc;te d&rsquo;Azur, Alsace is actually quite affordable. Being close to the German border, supermarkets such as Lidl offer a way to shop on a budget; I found that the fresh fruit and vegetables from Lidl were of much better quality than the equivalent products in the nearby French supermarket, Hyper-U. In Colmar, the two cinemas are reasonably priced &ndash; morning screenings at the CGR are &euro;5.70 (otherwise &euro;6.10 for students), whilst Le Colis&eacute;e is &euro;5 for students for all screenings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the eating-out front, meat was a significantly more expensive option in many restaurants &ndash; though tarte flamb&eacute;e, the regional speciality, was a reliably cheap option (a basic one, with onions and cr&egrave;me Fraiche, usually set you back around &euro;7.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>9. It&rsquo;s home to some of France&rsquo;s best vineyards<br />\r\nFrom the off, I&rsquo;ll admit I&rsquo;m not really a fan of wine. However, for those that are: welcome to wine heaven. The Route des Vins is the ultimate wine tour of the region; plenty of vineyards offer tastings. Naturally, said wine is also priced perfectly for students&rsquo; budgets in the local supermarkets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>10. There&rsquo;s so much food to try<br />\r\nShamefully, I never quite managed to face choucroute (the infamous cabbage dish with sausages and other charcuterie) but I did develop a love for pretzels (both salty and sweet), a preference for tarte flamb&eacute;e sucr&eacute;e (over standard, savoury tarte flamb&eacute;e) and become a huge fan of pain d&rsquo;&eacute;pices. That&rsquo;s progress for a picky eater, right? The tourte de la Vall&eacute;e is a delicious speciality from the Vall&eacute;e de Munster, which also produces a particularly strong cheese. Another popular option is raclette &ndash; similar to a cheese fondue, it involves melting cheese and then pouring it over potatoes and meat.</p>",

At low tide, you can even collect your own seafood, which is a popular pastime in Brittany. If you want something cooked by the pros, try the famous platter \u0091plateau de fruits de mer\u0092, or go for a hearty bowl of moule marini&egrave;res.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Historical Monuments</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After Paris, Brittany is France&rsquo;\u0092s largest historical heritage region &ndash; it is home to over 2,900 protected monuments; perfect for those who are fascinated by history. Choose from fortified towns like Saint-Malo, medieval castles such as that of Fougeres or even a visit to the historic capital of Nantes among other historical attractions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hiking and Cycling</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For those who like to be active, you\u0092&rsquo;ll find it easy to explore Brittany on foot or by bike. Cycle through the apple orchards or along the coastal path of the C&ocirc;te Sauvage, or alternatively, hike through the Broc&eacute;liande forest or over the Monts d&rsquo;Arr&eacute;e moors \u0096 the choice is yours!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bird Sanctuaries</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Boasting around 800 islands and islets, Brittany is home to several species of birdlife you&rsquo;\u0092ll struggle to spot anywhere else. Head off the beaten track and take a boat out to sea, where you&rsquo;\u0092ll find a plethora of birds, especially around the islands of Br&eacute;hat, &Icirc;le de Sein, &Icirc;le de Batz, Belle-&Icirc;le and &Icirc;le aux Moines in the Morbihan Gulf.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Restaurants</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We\u0092&rsquo;ve already mentioned the seafood, but there\u0092s a whole host of other great cuisines to sample in Brittany, too.

The vast majority of the sea resorts have yachting clubs where equipment hire and sailing lessons are all on offer, or, for a slower pace, gently cruise along over 600km of canals and rivers. If you\u0092&rsquo;d rather watch the professionals in action, Brittany also hosts several boat races and regattas throughout the year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Climate</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brittany\u0092&rsquo;s mild climate means that you can visit all year round. \u0096In the summer temperatures are a pleasant 20-25&deg;C, while in the winter, temperatures are between 8-15&deg;C. Its positioning with the Gulf stream also means that Brittany avoids the harsher weather experienced in the regions of France that are further north.</p>",

        "Explain_each_feature": "<p>1. Grande Plage<br />\r\nBiarritz&#39; most central beach, the Grande Plage has attracted high-society vacationers since the Belle Epoque. This wide, sandy beach begins at Bellevue near the Boulevard du G&eacute;n&eacute;ral de Gaulle and extends to the H&ocirc;tel du Palais. In summertime, the beach is covered with sunbathers and their colorful striped cabanas.<br />\r\nLifeguards are on duty from May through October with more extended hours during the high season. However, it is important to note that this beach has heavy surf, and water safety is posted on a daily basis. During certain periods of strong currents, bathing, swimming, and surfing are prohibited.<br />\r\nAlongside the beach, the Quai de la Plage promenade is perfect for taking a leisurely stroll. This wide pedestrian walkway offers vistas of the breaking waves and the Biarritz lighthouse in the distance.<br />\r\nOn a headland at the end of the Grande Plage is the H&ocirc;tel du Palais Biarritz. Built by the Emperor Napoleon III for his wife Eug&eacute;nie, this gorgeous palace is a classified Historic Monument exemplifying opulent Second Empire style. Since 1893, the building has been used as a hotel. This luxurious five-star property features a spa, fitness center, and an outdoor swimming pool.<br />\r\nThe H&ocirc;tel du Palais is also prized for its restaurant, which offers guests a refined gastronomic experience in an exquisite dining room with ocean views. Guests are treated to the finest Basque cuisine while watching the surf crash against the shore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. Plage du Miramar<br />\r\nThis beautiful beach is a place to relax and enjoy the refreshing seaside breezes. Extending from the H&ocirc;tel du Palais to the Pointe Saint-Martin, the Plage du Miramar is distinguished by its spectacular scenery and dramatic shore-breaking waves.<br />\r\nAlthough the sheltered beach offers a sense of tranquility, rough seas and strong currents (including riptides) make swimming dangerous. The condition of the waves and currents should be considered before entering the water. Lifeguards are on duty in July and August.<br />\r\nMiramar Beach is less touristy than the Grande Plage and has the charm of an old-fashioned seaside resort&mdash;especially in summertime when vintage-style, striped beach tents make their appearance.<br />\r\nThe beach attracts sunbathers, and spa-goers, who frequent the nearby Thalassa Sea &amp; Spa center in the five-star Sofitel Hotel.<br />\r\nJust off the coast is a huge rock, the Roche Ronde, a protected nature area and bird sanctuary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3. Biarritz Aquarium<br />\r\nThis exceptional aquarium is perched on a cliffside, a breathtaking piece of oceanfront property opposite the Rocher de la Vierge. One of the largest aquariums in Europe, the 7,000-meter space features more than 20 aquarium tanks.<br />\r\nThe natural-looking aquarium tanks are filled with a wide range of amazing species, from lobsters and sea urchins to turtles and hammerhead sharks. The aquariums represent species from all the Seven Seas, including an array of tropical fish and an 11-meter-long Caribbean lagoon.<br />\r\nOne of the highlights of the Biarritz Aquarium is the outdoor terrace, with a seal pool, where the adorable sea mammals swim and play. The twice-daily (10:30am and 5pm) seal feeding time is a popular event &mdash; especially for families with children. It&#39;s fun to watch how quickly the seals gobble up huge amounts of fish. The outdoor terrace also offers astounding 180-degree ocean views.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4. Biarritz Lighthouse<br />\r\nThe emblematic Biarritz lighthouse stands at an essential location overlooking the coastline of the Cape Hainsart. Built in 1834, the lighthouse is at the tip of the Pointe Saint-Martin, which marks a boundary between the sandy beaches of the Landes Coast to the south and the rocky coastline to the north.<br />\r\nVisitors may climb the 248 steps of the lighthouse to take in the scenery from this incredible vantage point. The 73-meter-high lighthouse commands sweeping panoramas of Biarritz and the Basque countryside.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>5. Elegant Boulevards and Squares</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The elegant boulevards, streets, and squares of Biarritz exemplify the city&#39;s aristocratic heritage. At the urban center of Biarritz is the grand Place Georges-Clemenceau, which joins with several of the city&#39;s principal streets. From here, it is a short distance to the Place Bellevue, a semicircular square with panoramic views of the beach and the ocean.<br />\r\nTo the south of the Place Bellevue is another scenic area of Biarritz along the Boulevard Mar&eacute;chal-Leclerc. Nestled in the steep, rocky inlet between the Rocher du Basta and Cap Atalaye, above the old fishing harbor, this seaside boulevard is a wonderful starting point for a scenic walking tour along the Biarritz coast.<br />\r\nWith so many wonderful sights, Biarritz is a delightful place for a scenic stroll or a guided walking tour to learn about the history while admiring the views.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>6. Miremont Tearoom</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Miremont is renowned for its refined ambience and classic French p&acirc;tisserie, such as &eacute;clairs, G&acirc;teau Saint-Honor&eacute;, and strawberry tart, as well as its selection of rare teas.<br />\r\nHoused in an elegant 17th-century building, this historic tearoom is one of the oldest establishments in Biarritz.<br />\r\nFounded in 1872, the Miremont was frequented by royalty during Biarritz&#39; glory days. Spain&#39;s King Alphonso XIII enjoyed having lunch here. King Edward VII of England appreciated the Miremont&#39;s refined French pastries. Queen Nathalie of Serbia often purchased caramels for her friends, and Queen Amelia of Portugal had a habit of taking her tea at a window seat with the best view.<br />\r\nThe Miremont&#39;s dining room offers an outlook onto the Grande Plage and the H&ocirc;tel du Palais. Upstairs, the salon features pastel pink decor and seems perfectly appointed for a gathering place of aristocratic ladies.<br />\r\nTourists may sample the pastries or have lunch in the tea room. The confections are also available to go, and the shop sells gift boxes of chocolates, caramels, and other candies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>7. Rocher de la Vierge (Virgin of the Rock)<br />\r\nThe Rocher de la Vierge is a truly dramatic landmark&mdash;a statue of the Virgin Mary set on a steep, narrow rock in the ocean. According to a local legend, fishermen caught out at sea in a storm were guided back to the port by what seemed to be a divine light. In gratitude, the fishermen installed a statue of the Virgin Mary on the rock.<br />\r\nNapoleon III decided to make the site accessible from the shore and in 1887 asked Gustave Eiffel to create a sturdy metal bridge.<br />\r\nTo arrive at the Virgin Mary statue, tourists must walk across the &quot;Passerelle Eiffel&quot; (pedestrian bridge), suspended high above the pounding waves of the ocean. The bridge affords awe-inspiring panoramas of the coastline, extending from the mouth of the Adour River to the Spanish frontier.<br />\r\nOther marvelous viewpoints of the Basque coastline can be found nearby at the Esplanade du Rocher-de-la-Vi&egrave;rge and at the Esplanade du Port-Vieux, where there is a magnificent prospect of the cliff-fringed C&ocirc;te des Basques, exposed to the full force of the breakers, extending all the way to the hills of Spain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>8. Chapelle Imp&eacute;riale<br />\r\nEmpress Eug&eacute;nie requested the creation of this Imperial Chapel for her own personal spiritual worship. Built in 1865, the chapel is dedicated to the Virgin of Guadalupe (Mexico&#39;s patron saint).<br />\r\nClassified as a Historic Monument, this little gem of a chapel reveals an eclectic yet harmonious blend of architectural elements: Romanesque-inspired arches, Moorish design motifs, and glittering Byzantine-style gilded mosaics. The ornate details add up to an enchanting interior, which dazzles the eyes.<br />\r\nThe chapel is open to the public for visits and guided tours. The hours vary throughout the year, with less frequent opening times in the off season.<br />\r\nMass is held here four times a year on specific dates: January 9th to commemorate the death of Napoleon III; June 1st, the anniversary of the death of Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte, the Prince Imp&eacute;rial (the only child of Napoleon and Eug&eacute;nie) who was killed in action during the Anglo-Zulu War; July 11th to commemorate of the death of Empress Eug&eacute;nie; and December 12th to celebrate the Feast Day of the Virgin of Guadalupe.<br />\r\nPrior to the construction of the Imperial Chapel, the Empress Eug&eacute;nie, Emperor Napoleon III, and the Imperial family attended mass at the Eglise Sainte-Eug&eacute;nie near the old port. This neo-Gothic chapel was inaugurated in 1856 and is dedicated to the patron saint of the empress.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>9. Surfing Beaches<br />\r\nThe C&ocirc;te des Basques is the most famous surfing beach in Biarritz and is said to be the birthplace of surfing. The impressive waves provide challenging conditions for surfing, and many competitions are held here. The beach is enclosed by cliffs and accessible by a staircase or pedestrian path.<br />\r\nSwimming is allowed except when prohibited during high tide. This beach is also a lovely place to stroll along the ocean while taking in the coastal scenery.<br />\r\nNext to the C&ocirc;te des Basques, the Plage de Marbella is another favorite of surfers and bodyboarders because of its powerful waves. This unspoiled, sandy beach is wild and rugged and is only accessible by a staircase. (Access is difficult for people with limited mobility.)<br />\r\nFor those interested in learning how to surf in Biarritz, one recommendation is a Private Surf Lesson. This two-hour lesson includes equipment and instructions at a suitable surfing spot.<br />\r\nSafety notes: Beginning surfers should be advised on how and when to enter and get out of the water to avoid hitting the stones.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>10. Day Trip to Saint-Jean-de-Luz<br />\r\nAn old fishing village with a typical Basque character, Saint-Jean-de-Luz is steeped in history. Tourists will enjoy the lively atmosphere, local culture, and delicious food.<br />\r\nA popular summertime destination, Saint-Jean-de-Luz boasts attractive sandy beaches with gentle waters (thanks to protection from the ocean by a sea wall). The beaches are ideal for swimming and appeal to families with kids.<br />\r\nSaint-Jean-de-Luz is just a 30-minute drive south of Biarritz. It&#39;s worth taking the time to discover this traditional Basque seaside town, which is quite different from the glitzy resort of Biarritz.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>11. Basque Country Excursion: Village of Espelette<br />\r\nFor an authentic taste of the Basque Country, one of the best places to visit is Espelette (a 30-minute drive from Biarritz). This picturesque village is renowned for its red peppers.<br />\r\nThe town&#39;s traditional Basque houses are brightly decorated with neatly lined rows of dried peppers, which are grown on nearby farms. With an AOC label designating the geographical origin and quality, the Piment d&#39;Espelette is a key ingredient in Basque cooking.<br />\r\nIn late October, at the end of the harvest season, the town of Espelette hosts the F&ecirc;te du Piment d&#39;Espelette (Pepper Festival). During this festival, the farmers market presents Piment d&#39;Espelette peppers and other regional gastronomic products available for sale. Festival-goers will also enjoy the traditional parade and hearty country meals with musical entertainment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>12. Eglise Orthodoxe de Biarritz<br />\r\nThis Byzantine-style Russian Orthodox church was designed by the renowned Biarritz architect Tisn&eacute;s. It was built in 1892 for a community of Russian immigrants (mostly aristocrats). Gilded icons from Saint Petersburg adorn the interior, creating the impression of a glittering jewel box.<br />\r\nThe church offers prayer services on Sundays. Visits are possible on certain days of the week. It&#39;s recommended to check the schedule in advance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>13. Kid-Friendly Beaches<br />\r\nThis small, sheltered beach of Le Port Vieux is an excellent choice for families with children. The beach is found in a rocky inlet of the Port Vieux (Old Harbor) near the city center.<br />\r\nBecause the beach is in a protected cove, the waves are gentle, and the waters are safer here than at the Grande Plage and especially the Plage du Miramar. The conditions are usually calm enough for swimming, and the shallow areas are safe for kids to bathe and splash around, under supervision.<br />\r\nSince Le Port Vieux is less crowded than other Biarritz beaches, it is ideal for summertime relaxation. Another great beach for children is the Plage de la Milady, which features a seaside boardwalk and playground.<br />\r\nBathing and swimming is permitted, except when the waters are rough. One caution: The zone of surveillance increases at low tide. The Plage de Milady is very popular with locals and bodyboarders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>14. Cit&eacute; de l&#39;Oc&eacute;an<br />\r\nIn a sleek contemporary building close to the Plage de la Milady, this museum is dedicated to educating the public about the science of the oceans. The museum&#39;s creative and interactive exhibits make learning about ocean-related topics fun and interesting.<br />\r\nExhibits focus on specific concepts, such as climate change and the origin of waves. A virtual surfing experience allows visitors to feel what it&#39;s like to ride the ocean waves without getting wet. In a small theater, the museum screens a 3-D show, which simulates being in a submarine 1,000 meters underwater.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>15. UNESCO-listed Saint-Jean Pied de Port<br />\r\nAnother day-trip worthy destination is the Basque village of Saint-Jean Pied de Port. Located at the foot of the Pyrenees Mountains (a one-hour drive from Biarritz) at an elevation of 1,300 meters, the town was one of the most difficult stages of the medieval Way of Saint James pilgrimage route to Santiago de Compostela in Spain.<br />\r\nListed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, the old quarter has charming cobblestone streets and a noteworthy 13th-century church &mdash; the Eglise Notre-Dame du Bout du Pont. Many modern pilgrims still begin their Camino de Santiago pilgrimage journey here.<br />\r\nThe pristine countryside around the village is also a fantastic place for hiking and nature walks or just for relaxing and meditating in the lush landscape.<br />\r\nIn August, the town hosts the F&ecirc;tes de St. Jean Pied de Port, a traditional Basque festival with dance and music performances.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>16. Mus&eacute;e d&#39;Art Asiatique (Museum of Asian Art)<br />\r\nThis surprising museum displays one of Europe&#39;s top collections of Asian art. There are more than 1,000 pieces of artwork representing different historical periods, from ancient to modern times. The collections represent the work of different countries, including China, India, Nepal, and Tibet.</p>",
        "Reasons_to_visit": "<p>Goodies For the Foodies<br />\r\nOne of the best things about France is that as you&rsquo;re traveling across the country, you get to taste each region&rsquo;s delicacies. Taste some Bayonne ham, ardi gasna (sheep cheese), ttoro, and spice up your meals with some Espelette pepper. You can thank us later.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Experience Slow Life<br />\r\nAlthough Biarritz is quite crowded and very animated during the summer, it&rsquo;s also the perfect place to chill. Enjoy the lazy mornings, having long meals in trendy places by the seaside, spending the day at the beach perfecting your tan, and sitting on a nice terrace with a drink before your night out. And when you wake up the next morning with blurry memories from the night before, do it again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Diversity of the Region<br />\r\nOnce you have visited Biarritz&rsquo;s historical sites and surfed the area&rsquo;s waves to exhaustion, take some time to explore the cities close by&mdash;Anglet for its incredible spas, Bayonne for its exquisite gastronomy and Guethary, Saint Jean de Luz, and Hendaye if you are on a mission to experiment on all the waves in the area.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Spain is Around the Corner<br />\r\nPlanning to visit multiple cities or countries in one trip can be a pain sometimes. With the Spanish frontier only 30 minutes away, you should definitively spend at least one day in San Sebastian.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Outdoor Sports<br />\r\nLying on the beach all day is probably your sole plan when arriving in Biarritz (and that&rsquo;s perfectly fine), but there are plenty of outdoor activities that you might want to try during your stay. If surfing is the most widespread activity on the beach, you can also play beach rugby, play golf or try out chistera (Basque pelota), the traditional sport of the region.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nPeople playing chistera<br />\r\nOne of the reasons why more and more of people come each summer to Biarritz is that they can party on the beach during the day and move to the nightclubs very close to the sea at night. In addition to that, there are numerous ferias (local festivals) throughout the summer where you get to party with the locals and experience another side of the region&rsquo;s culture while having a blast.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Suspended between heaven and earth on a sheer limestone cliff, Rocamadour is an unforgettable sacred site. In the 11th century, this pilgrimage destination was the third most important in Christendom after Jerusalem and Rome. Rocamadour was also a stop on the medieval&nbsp;<strong>Way of Saint James</strong>&nbsp;pilgrimage trail to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.planetware.com/tourist-attractions-/santiago-de-compostela-e-gal-sancom.htm\">Santiago de la Compostela</a>&nbsp;in Spain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The village has seven ancient sanctuaries, but pilgrims flock to the&nbsp;<strong>Chapelle Notre-Dame</strong>&nbsp;(Chapelle Miraculeuse), which possesses the venerated&nbsp;<strong>Black Virgin</strong>&nbsp;(Notre-Dame de Rocamadour). This precious Virgin Mary figure was carved from walnut wood that naturally darkened over the centuries and is associated with miracles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another must-see sight is the UNESCO-listed&nbsp;<strong>Basilique Saint-Sauveur</strong>, the largest church of Rocamadour built in Romanesque and Gothic style between the 11th and 13th centuries.

        "Explain_each_feature": "<p><strong>A great pilgrimage site</strong><br />\r\nJust southwest of Padirac in the Causses du Quercy Regional Nature Park stands the sacred village of Rocamadour. Built on 3 successive levels, Rocamadour is both a place of legend and history where old stone houses, majestic towers and a castle keep cascade off the cliff into the Alzou Canyon.<br />\r\nNot only is the village one of France&#39;s most important tourist destinations and a UNESCO World Heritage Site, it has also been a crucial pilgrimage site on the &#39;Way of Saint James&#39; for hundreds of years.<br />\r\nRising up 120 metres, this vertiginous Citadel of Faith is best summed up by an old local saying: &#39;Houses on the river, churches on the houses, rocks on the churches, castle on the rock&#39;.<br />\r\nThe sacred city of Rocamadour boasts 4 beautiful arched stone gates: Porte Basse, Porte du Figuier, Porte Salmon and Porte Hugon.<br />\r\nThe town below the monastic buildings lies on the lowest slopes. Trimmed with beautiful gold stone houses and lauz&eacute; roofs, the main street is entirely car-free and houses a number of charming restaurants and quirky boutiques.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A thousand years of History:</strong><br />\r\nIn 1166, an incorruptible body was found buried where the Sanctuary now lays. This discovery propelled Rocamadour to become one of the 4 most important pilgrimage sites in medieval Christiandom, attracting Kings and paupers alike.<br />\r\nThe 216 steps that make up the Great Staircase separate the lower town from the complex of religious structures that are set halfway up the cliff. The Sanctuary made of 8 chapels is built around a central courtyard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Chapelle Notre Dame and the Vierge Noire statue are the highlights of any visitor&#39;s trip. Carved from the wood of a walnut tree in the 12th century, the Black Madonna has ever since drawn worshippers from all over Europe in search of miracles.<br />\r\nOverhead, the 9th-century iron bell is said to ring on its own when somewhere in the world the Virgin performes a miracle. Many recorded miracles are linked to sailors in peril at sea, hence the boats hanging from the ceiling.<br />\r\nBacked against the cliffs next to the chapel lies the UNESCO-listed Basilique Saint-Sauveur, built in the Romanesque-Gothic style. The medieval city is also home to the crypt of Saint-Amadour, just below the basilica.<br />\r\nAs an act of penance in previous times, pilgrims would do the 216-step climb to the Sanctuary on their knees. However, today&#39;s visitors mostly concentrate on getting to the top without losing their breath (big pat on the back for those who do...) No need to fear though, 2 lifts linking the lower town to the castle are available for the less sporty vacationers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong>Sightseeing in Rocamadour:</strong><br />\r\nRocamadour&#39;s stunning castle was built to defend the village&#39;s Sanctuary in the Middle Ages and sits proudly at the top of the village in an extraordinary balancing act.<br />\r\nOnly the castle&rsquo;s ramparts are open to visitors but the viewpoints over the Alzou Valley are simply breathtaking. Remember to keep an eye out for the birds flying to and from the &lsquo;Rocher des Aigles&rsquo; falconry display nearby.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Visitors that have still got energy to burn and who are looking for a glimpse of the village as a whole should take the shady path towards L&#39;Hospitalet. Inhabitated as early as the Upper Palaeolithic era, this hamlet offres a picture-postcard view of the golden stone village cascading into the canyon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nearby, the prehistoric Grotte des Merveilles boasts an underground world of stalactites, lakes and original Paleolithic drawings of horses and deer that date back to 20,000 B.C. The pre-historic artists created the paintings by airbrushing red and black pigment onto the rocks using animal bones and a variety of different stencils like hands. The cave is easily accessible with only a short walk down some steps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The monkey park &quot;La For&ecirc;t des Singes&quot; is also a must while visiting Rocamadour, particularly with children. A chance to get up close and personal with 150 barbary macaques roaming free in a large shady park.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Keep in mind that the village continues to be an active place of worship so it&#39;s advised to dress accordingly. With a million visitors flocking to Rocamadour every year, try and plan a visit to the sacred marvel early in the morning as it can often get quite busy during the day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Events in Rocamadour:</strong><br />\r\n<em>Cheese Festival:</em><br />\r\nA speciality in Rocamadour and the Quercy Limestone plateaus, Rocamadour cheese or &#39;Cab&eacute;cou&#39; is made with unpasteurized goat&#39;s milk and has been designated the AOC quality label.<br />\r\nPresented in the shape of a small disk, Rocamadour cheese can either be eaten warm on a slice of walnut bread or in a salad and will undoubtedly tickle any cheese lover&#39;s tastebuds.<br />\r\nIn June, the Rocamadour AOC cheese festival is celebrated on Pentecost Sunday with a large market, cheese tasting, live music and activities for the kiddies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Hot-air balloon Festival:</em><br />\r\nEvery last weekend of September, the annual Hot Air Balloon Festival &quot;Les Montgolfiades&quot; sees 30-odd participants from all over Europe taking to skies from the foot of the Sacred City.<br />\r\nRemember to make an early start as over 20,000 spectators come to enjoy the show each year. Visitors can choose to watch from various slopes in the surrounding valley.<br />\r\nThere&rsquo;s also a fantastic firework display as well as a great brocante for those looking to take home a French antique and spruce it up a little.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Summer pasture:</em><br />\r\nAnother of Rocamadour&#39;s events takes place in spring when hundreds of sheep migrate from Rocamadour to the uplands for the annual Transhumance. Visitors and locals are welcome to join the flock for a five day walk along the Dordogne&#39;s idyllic country lanes and paths guided by local shepherds that know the region like the backs of their hands.</p>",
        "Reasons_to_visit": "<p>Rocamadour France. The name alone conjures up a mystical aura. Let it roll off your tongue. You know right away there is a story behind this name, Rocamadour France. Rocamadour has been a pilgrimage site for centuries attracting pilgrims and nobility from far and wide. Seven medieval chapels are carved into the cliffside overlooking the River Alzou and the 216 steps of the Grand Escalier (Grand Staircase) have been ascended a million times over.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The UNESCO site of Rocamadour France is a place where miracles happen. The existence of a black Madonna and an ancient bell that tolls all by itself when a miracle occurs at sea make the site both spiritual and magical. Rocamadour France is situated in the Lot region of Occitanie France and in the Causses du Quercy Regional Natural Park near the eastern border of the Dordogne Region. Ouf! No wonder I get confused by the regions of France. If you are planning a visit to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dreameratheart.org/visiting-the-dordogne-valley-9-picturesque-towns-to-explore/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>the Dordogne Valley</strong></a>&nbsp;or the Lot in France, add Rocamadour to your itinerary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1. Rocamadour France: It&rsquo;s Steeped In History</strong><br />\r\nRocamadour France - roses and stonework<br />\r\nPilgrims have been making their way to the holy pilgrimage site of Rocamadour since at least 1105. In 1152 a sanctuary was built to welcome the pilgrims.<br />\r\nWhen the body of Saint Amadour, an early Chrisitan hermit, was discovered in 1166, the fame of Rocamadour spread. An abbey was built in honour of Saint-Amadour and on top of the cliff, a fortress was constructed to protect the city.<br />\r\nRocamadour became a major stop on the Saint James&rsquo; Way pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela. But Rocamadour was devastated during the Hundreds Years War (1337-1453) and again in the Wars of the Religion (1562-1598). In fact, by the time the French Revolution began, Rocamadour was a mess. It was during the 19th century that Rocamadour France saw a rebuilding and revival to its glory days.<br />\r\nDuring all the years of destruction, the Black Madonna and the tolling bell somehow survived.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2. Rocamadour France: Stroll Through The Medieval City</strong><br />\r\nThe main street of Rocamadour France today is a pedestrian street lined with tourist boutiques. Stop for a minute and try to imagine a different scenario. One from hundreds of years ago where shop keepers welcomed pilgrims who had walked for weeks to arrive at this sacred place.<br />\r\none of the stone gates of Rocamadour<br />\r\nIt&rsquo;s incredible that the original stone gates still exist in Rocamadour France. There are four such beautifully preserved gates to enter the town: Porte Basse, Porte Hugon, Porte Salmon and Porte Figuier.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3. Follow In The Steps Of Pilgrims</strong><br />\r\nWord of miracles happening at Rocamadour spread drawing people to make their way to the holy site. Henry the II of England made his way to Rocamadour France as did King Louis IX of France.<br />\r\nStand at the bottom of the Grand Escalier, consisting of 216 steps, and imagine the pilgrims ascending on their knees, saying the rosary on each step.<br />\r\nUpon reaching the top they would receive a pardon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>4. See The Famous Black Madonna Of Rocamadour</strong><br />\r\nIn the Chapel of Notre-Dame (1479) is the famous wooden Black Madonna of Rocamadour France, with baby Jesus sitting on her knee. Reputed to have been carved by Saint-Amadour, people have come from all over the world to receive a blessing and ask for a miracle from the statue of the Virgin Mary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>5. Stare Up At The Powerful Sword Of Durandal</strong><br />\r\nAs you exit the chapel, look up high for the sword in the stone. Another legend full of magic and intrigue, this sword, called Durandal apparently belonged to Roland, a valiant knight and nephew of the famous Emperor Charlemagne. One legend states that in order to prevent this powerful sword from falling into the wrong hands, Roland, seriously injured on the battlefield, called on Archangel Saint-Michel for help. He flung his powerful sword into the air and Durandal landed in the rock face at Rocamadour France. It was the 8th century.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>6. Visit The Chapels At Rocamadour</strong><br />\r\nGorgeous stone work of Rocamadour France<br />\r\nExploring the chapels of Rocamadour is an experience. You never know what will happen! On my visit, while standing in the glorious Chapel of Notre-Dame, a man entered and started singing &ldquo;Ave Maria&rdquo; at the top of his voice. This is a sacred place where miracles happen and there is a definite aura.<br />\r\nStop by the Chapel of Saint-Michel with its majestic, colourful frescoes and stand before the crypt of Saint-Amadour. The Chapelle Saint-Louis, the newest chapel, has rugby shirts lining the walls. Look for the tree trunks where you can pin a prayer with a golden thumbtack.<br />\r\nStand and admire the stonework and the views over the town and the Alzou valley. It is remarkable just to be at Rocamadour.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UNESCO site magic<br />\r\n<strong>7. Walk Along The Ramparts</strong><br />\r\nWhen you have finished investigating the chapels, climb up to the cliff summit where the medieval fortress stands. It was originally built in the 13th and 14th centuries and restored in the 19th century. The sweeping views from the ramparts are unforgettable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>8. Rocamadour France: Have A Picnic Under Its Spell<br />\r\nIf you park below the village, there is a grassy area just perfect for a picnic. Eating in the open air with a glorious view of the UNESCO site Rocamadour was the perfect way to begin our visit. There are no picnic tables here, so bring a blanket to spread on the grass, a baguette, some Rocamadour cheese and&hellip;well&hellip; that is just the start!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>9. Savour Rocamadour Cheese</strong><br />\r\nIt seems only fitting if you are visiting Rocamadour that you sample the region&rsquo;s speciality &ndash; a delectable cheese. Once tasted, Rocamadour Fromage (cheese) will become a go-to! Made from unpasteurized whole goat&rsquo;s milk, Rocamadour Fromage can be eaten at any stage of maturation. I love this cheese with its creamy subtle flavour. Rocamadour cheese is perfect for picnics, eaten with salads and even eaten warm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>10. Rocamadour France: Practicalities</strong><br />\r\nThere are parking areas both above the village and below the village by the river. I parked by the river and walked up to Rocamadour. There is a train from this parking lot to the town.<br />\r\nThere are also lifts between the ramparts, the sanctuaries and the village.<br />\r\nRocamadour France: A Great View<br />\r\nStop at the village of l&rsquo;Hospitalet for great views of Rocamadour.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What Else To Visit Near Rocamadour</strong><br />\r\nThe lovely town of Carennac (Read about it here) is well worth a visit.<br />\r\nAlso if like caves, the caves of Gouffre de Padirac are closeby.<br />\r\nEvery year on the last weekend in September, the Montgolfiades de Rocamadour (Hot Air Balloon Festival) takes place. Imagine the sight of hot air balloons soaring by Rocamadour. Imagine being in one!</p>",

Alhambra: A Masterpiece of Islamic Architecture</strong><br />\r\nThe Alhambra stands majestically on a fortified hilltop with the snow-peaked Sierra Nevada Mountains as a backdrop. An absolute must-see attraction in Granada, this UNESCO-listed World Heritage site was the residence of the Moorish rulers of the Nasrid Dynasty for 250 glorious years, from the 13th to the 15th centuries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The complex of palaces was the Moors&#39; last stronghold in Spain. A veritable museum of Islamic architecture, the Alhambra is surrounded by ancient defensive walls and appears from afar to be an impenetrable fortress.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Alhambra complex consists of four groups of buildings in carefully landscaped grounds. The Alcazaba is the original 13th-century Moorish fortress, the oldest part of the Alhambra. All that remains of the Alcazaba are the ramparts and the towers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Nasrid Palaces are the most splendid buildings of the complex, with marvelous accommodations and public spaces used by the Sultans of the Nasrid Dynasty. Typical of secular Moorish buildings, the Nasrid Palaces are plain on the exterior but sumptuous on the interior, with decorative tile work and peaceful courtyards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Palace of Charles V was built in the 16th century after the conquest of the Moors and was used by the Spanish emperor as his summer palace.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Beautiful and serene Moorish gardens surround the Generalife Palace, which was used as a leisure villa by the sultans of Granada. The grounds feature shady patios, fountains, fragrant roses, and flower-adorned terraces overlooking the places of the Alhambra and the mountains.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tip: To save save time and avoid standing in a long line at the palace entrance, consider joining the Skip-the-Line Alhambra Half-Day Tour. This guided experience includes hotel pickup; priority access; and an informative walking tour that covers the Nasrid Palaces, Palace of Charles V, and Generalife Gardens.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong>2. Albaic&iacute;n and Mirador of San Nicolas</strong><br />\r\nOne of the most enchanting things to do in Granada is to get lost in the hillside neighborhood of the Albaic&iacute;n, a UNESCO-listed World Heritage site. The Albaic&iacute;n, Granada&#39;s medieval Arabic quarter, was once surrounded by defensive walls and has retained an authentic Moorish character thanks to its picturesque narrow streets and simple whitewashed houses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From Puerta Nueva (Puerta de los Estandartes), a well-preserved stretch of the town&#39;s old ramparts runs west to the Puerta Monaita. The best view of the walls is from the Cuesta de la Alhacaba, near the ninth-century Puerta de Elvira, once the town&#39;s principal gate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many places in the Albaic&iacute;n offer stunning outlooks onto the Alhambra complex, which is separated from the Albaic&iacute;n by the dramatic gorge of the R&iacute;o Darro.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most spectacular viewpoint in the Albaic&iacute;n is the Mirador of San Nicolas, the terrace in front of the 16th-century Church of San Nicolas at the heart of the Albaic&iacute;n quarter. This frequently painted panorama captures the Alhambra Palace and the Sierra Nevada Mountains.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not far from San Nicholas, the Church of San Salvador was built on the site of an earlier mosque and is noteworthy for its Mud&eacute;jar style (Christian architecture influenced by Islamic design).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another fabulous view of the Alhambra that is popular with tourists is from the Carrera del Darro, one of the oldest streets in Granada, which runs along the north side of the R&iacute;o Darro.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3. Capilla Real de Granada (Royal Chapel of Granada)</strong><br />\r\nThe grandeur of Spain&#39;s Catholic Monarchs is best seen at the Capilla Real de Granada, which houses the royal tombs. This impressive 47-meter-high domed chapel is attached to the Catedral Santa Mar&iacute;a de la Encarnaci&oacute;n but has a separate entrance; it was an addition to the cathedral built from 1506 to 1521 in Late Gothic style.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The interior features beautiful 16th-century stained-glass windows and seven large paintings by Alonso Cano. An elaborately wrought grille by Bartolom&eacute; de Ja&eacute;n encloses the richly decorated royal tombs. To the right is the Tomb of Ferdinand and Isabella in a monument of Carrara marble created by sculptor Domenico Fancelli of Florence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The crypt houses sarcophagi of other kings and princes. To the left is the tomb of Philip the Handsome and Joan the Mad by Bartolom&eacute; Ord&oacute;&ntilde;ez. A large beautifully carved retablo behind the royal tombs features statues of the Catholic Monarchs by Diego de Silo&eacute;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the transepts are richly decorated relicarios (side altars) by Alonso de Mena. The north transept displays the famous Triptych of the Passion by Dieric Bouts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A highlight of the Capilla Real is the Sacristy-Museum, a treasure trove of artwork, including Botticelli&#39;s Christ on the Mount of Olives painting, Rogier van der Weyden&#39;s Piet&agrave;, and Hans Memling&#39;s Descent from the Cross. The collection also displays polychrome wood figures of the Catholic Monarchs in prayer by Felipe Vigarny; King Ferdinand&#39;s sword; Queen Isabella&#39;s crown; and a prayer book, which belonged to the Catholic Monarchs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>4. Catedral Santa Mar&iacute;a de la Encarnaci&oacute;n</strong><br />\r\nGranada&#39;s Cathedral of Santa Mar&iacute;a de la Encarnaci&oacute;n is arguably the finest Renaissance church in Spain. The cathedral was built by Queen Isabella as a monument to the victory of Christian Spain over the Moors. It stands on the site of a former mosque.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Begun in Gothic style in 1523 and continued in Plateresque style from 1525, the cathedral was consecrated in 1561 while still unfinished.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 16th-century west facade features a large relief by Jos&eacute; Risue&ntilde;o over the main doorway. The northwest side of the cathedral is also richly decorated with ornate sculptures. On the entrance arch pillars are statues of the Catholic Monarchs and bronze statues of the Apostles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Visitors enter the cathedral through the main doorway and revel in the Renaissance splendor of the interior with its spacious nave and ornately adorned chapels. Exquisitely decorated, the Capilla Mayor (Main Chapel) exemplifies harmonious Renaissance architecture that was perfected in Granada during the 16th century.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The choir boasts two impressive Baroque organs, which sound out sacred melodies during religious services. Mass is celebrated at the cathedral on Sundays and holidays. Special religious ceremonies are held for Semana Santa (Easter week) and for the Catholic holidays during Christmastime (Navidad).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The cathedral&#39;s Sala Exposici&oacute;n (museum) displays a collection of religious art, including paintings, sculptures, tapestries, and sacred objects. Highlights are the large silver monstrance and the Flemish tapestries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>5. The Gypsy Quarter of Sacromonte</strong><br />\r\nGranada&#39;s colorful Gypsy quarter on the Sacromonte (&quot;sacred mount&quot;) is a fascinating place to visit. This hilltop neighborhood begins around the Cuesta del Chapiz, where the Camino del Sacromonte ascends the hill. The Gypsies (Gitanos) have had a presence in Granada since 1532 and settled in the caves of Sacromonte in the 18th century.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tourists will enjoy wandering the hillside roads of this atmospheric neighborhood to discover the artistic Gypsy homes; some are decorated with vibrant handcrafted ceramics. The caves in the upper area of the Camino del Sacromonte are in the best condition, and one has been made into a museum, so you can see inside.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tourists can find many cave venues in Sacromonte where flamenco is performed, including Cueva de la Roc&iacute;o, whose famous guests have included the King of Spain, Bill Clinton, and Michelle Obama. The Cueva de la Roc&iacute;o is renowned for La Zambra, a special type of flamenco dancing and singing that originated in the gypsy caves of Granada.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Sacromonte offers some of the best views in Granada, with panoramas over rugged ravines, the Valparaiso Valley, and the Darro River. Some vantage points look out to the Alhambra Palace and the Albaic&iacute;n.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A steep and picturesque footpath (a difficult walk) climbs through deeply indented gullies to the Ermita San Miguel de Alto. This 17th-century Baroque hermitage has a magnificent viewpoint of the Alhambra and the Albaic&iacute;n.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another noteworthy religious monument is the Sacromonte Abbey. Built in the 17th and 18th centuries, the Abbey&#39;s church is a gem of Baroque architecture. Standing on Mount Valparaiso and accessible by the Camino del Sacromonte (a 10-minute taxi ride from the Plaza Nueva), the Abbey is open for guided tours. Several caves were found on this site, which possess precious relics of the 16th century, as well as a cross of Saint John.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>6. The Ba&ntilde;uelo: Traditional Arab Baths</strong><br />\r\nThe Moors brought the ritual of the hammam (Arab Baths) from their homeland in North Africa to Andalusia, and Granada&#39;s 11th-century Ba&ntilde;uelo are among the oldest and best preserved in Spain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the few bath complexes not destroyed after the Reconquista by the Catholic monarchs, who considered the baths as immoral, they are one of Granada&#39;s oldest surviving Moorish sites.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today, visitors can sample a similar experience to the Arab baths at the Hammam Al &Aacute;ndalus near Plaza Nueva. Although it is on the site of an original Moorish bathhouse and constructed in the authentic style, with graceful arches and exquisite Islamic-style tile work, this hammam is a newly built replica and offers the latest pampering spa services.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>7. Parque de las Ciencias (Science Park)</strong><br />\r\nFamilies traveling with young children will find plenty to discover at this Science Park, which is about a 15-minute walk from the historic center of Granada. The complex includes a Biosphere Pavilion, which explores the Earth&#39;s geology and environment; the Perception Pavilion, which features vision-oriented technologies such as a giant kaleidoscope; and several other pavilions with kid-pleasing science exhibits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&#39;s also a Planetarium, which projects 7,000 stars, and outdoor exhibit areas that explore topics such as botany, mechanics, perception, and energy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>8. La Alcaicer&iacute;a (Arab Spice Market)</strong><br />\r\nThis traditional Arab bazaar is a recreation of the old Moorish market that existed here before the fire in 1843 destroyed the area. Close to the cathedral, the Alcaicer&iacute;a runs on the Calle de la Alcaicer&iacute;a from the Plaza Alonso Cano.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The entire neighbourhood of the Alcaicer&iacute;a, a maze of narrow streets, once held the silk and spices market. The Alcaicer&iacute;a recalls the original souk, but nowadays the vendors cater mostly to tourists.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nearby is Plaza Bib Rambla, a spacious public square that teems with people and activity. An artistic fountain stands at the center of the square surrounded by decorative ironwork and colourful flower stands.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>9. The 16th-Century Monasterio de la Cartuja</strong><br />\r\nThis serene 16th-century monastery is on the outskirts of Granada, about 25 minutes from the center (one kilometer north of the Plaza del Triunfo). The Monasterio de la Cartuja, also known as the Monasterio de la Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora de la Asunci&oacute;n, belonged to the Carthusian order that was founded in France in the 11th century.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Behind the simple exterior and courtyard is a surprisingly opulent interior. The monastery&#39;s ornately decorated church is one of the most extravagant religious buildings in Spain. The 17th-century Baroque sanctuary leaves visitors awestruck with its marvelous display of lavish paintings, marble statues, gilded details, and impressive altar pieces.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most striking feature of the church is the sacristy, designed by Luis de Ar&eacute;valo, with a riot of elaborate stucco ornamentation and marble pilasters. The refectory displays a painting of the Last Supper by Fray Juan Sanchez Cot&aacute;n.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Monasterio de la Cartuja is open to the public for visits (entrance fee required) everyday year-round, except during religious services and on December 25th and January 1st. The monument closes early on December 24th and December 31st</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>10. Bas&iacute;lica de San Juan de Dios</strong><br />\r\nAmid the beautiful medieval Islamic art and architecture, Granada&#39;s masterpiece of Baroque often goes unnoticed. The Bas&iacute;lica de San Juan de Dios immerses visitors into a fantasy of ornate decor and dazzling gold. Intricate gilded carvings adorn almost every corner of the ceiling, walls, and side-altars and frame the monumental paintings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The basilica is open to the public for visits (for an entrance fee) everyday year-round, except Mondays. An audio guide in English is included with the admission charge, pointing out details you might otherwise miss. If it is not evident, ask for access to the upper level behind the altar for a view down into the church.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>11. International Festival of Music and Dance</strong><br />\r\nThe wistful melodies of Gypsy guitar and flamboyant flamenco captivate audiences who attend this world-class festival. Held during June and July at wonderful venues, mostly historic monuments throughout Granada, the music and dance festival showcases the city&#39;s rich cultural heritage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The history of the festival dates back to 1883, when concerts were held at King Carlos V Palace. The festival continues the tradition with its showcasing of diverse Spanish musical styles and genres, such as opera, zarzuelas, flamenco, and Sephardic (Jewish) songs, as well as classical music piano recitals and symphony performances.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The concerts and performances take place at several outdoor locations within the Alhambra complex: the Palace of Charles V, El Patio de los Arrayanes, the Patio de la Acequia, and the P&oacute;rtico del Palacio del Partal. Other festival venues are found in the Albaic&iacute;n and Sacromonte neighborhoods. The festival draws more than 30,000 people every year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>12. Religious Events and Festivals</strong><br />\r\nMost of Granada&#39;s religious festivals originated during the Renaissance after the Reconquest. On January 2nd, Granada celebrates Conquest Day with a religious parade commemorating the conquest of Granada by the Catholic Monarchs (Queen Isabella and King Ferdinand) in 1491.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Three Wizards Parade on January 5th features a motley entourage of camels, horse and carriages, and circus characters in a lively procession through the city.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Saint Cecilio is Granada&#39;s patron saint, and February 1st is the Fiesta de San Cecilio. The festival takes place at the Sacromonte Abbey and includes religious events, music, dance, and delicious regional foods.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Holy Week is an important religious festival that celebrates Easter with religious masses, parades, and folkloric events. A highlight of Holy Week, the Cristo de los Gitanos (Christ of the Gypsies) procession to the Sacromonte is a special event with bonfires and saetas (traditional devotional songs).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of Granada&#39;s most important festivals, the Corpus Christi Procession on June 7th, features zambras moriscas (Moorish dances) and a parade of mythical characters such as giants, demons, and Tarasca, a woman on a dragon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On September 15th, pilgrims leave bouquets of flowers and single blossoms in front of the Bas&iacute;lica de la Virgen de las Angustias for the Floral Offering to the Virgen de las Angustias, Patron of the city.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Fiesta de San Miguel takes place at the end of September in the Albaic&iacute;n neighborhood with a religious parade to the chapel of the Ermita San Miguel de Alto, the legendary site of a miraculous olive tree</p>",
        "Reasons_to_visit": "<h2>Here are my top 10 reasons why you NEED to visit Granada</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong>1. Strangers treat you like family</strong><br />\r\nI&rsquo;ve never felt so welcome in a city before. On one trip, I was wandering through the Albayz&iacute;n neighbourhood alone. I stopped to eat at Arrayenes, a Moroccan style restaurant. The doors were open but the seats were empty and the lights were off. I peeked inside and shouted &ldquo;Hola?&rdquo;. The owner greeted me to say they were closed for Siesta. I never expected what would happen next.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This absolute stranger brought me to sit down and eat with his colleagues. They poured me Moroccan lemonade and fed me couscous. And they refused to let me pay anything! I was blown away.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Normally, business owners only care about making money. Yet, this guy was happy to feed me for nothing. I&rsquo;ll never forget that kind gesture. I even returned on my last visit to eat in the same restaurant with my boyfriend. When the owner realised who I was, he brought us complimentary tea and dessert.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Don&rsquo;t be surprised to meet these sort of people in Granada. Another time, I met three people from Granada in Morocco who hosted my friend and me in their home for nothing in return. Another time, a man who lives in the Sacromonte caves bought me a drink even though he had very little money.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s true that the people make the place. When I think of all the amazing people I&rsquo;ve met in different countries, a lot of them are from Granada.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2. The architecture</strong><br />\r\nThe bright white houses, potted flowers and windy cobbled streets in the Albayz&iacute;n are beautiful and make it for one of the reasons to visit Granada. You feel like a child again exploring the city and discovering hidden gems. It gives you an insight into Andalusian culture too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3. Home to a UNESCO world heritage site</strong><br />\r\nThe Alhambra is a 1,530,000 square foot Arabic palace and fortress. You can admire it from afar with a backdrop of the Sierra Nevada mountains. Or you can stroll around the palaces and gardens for hours to witness its beauty up close.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>4. The atmosphere</strong><br />\r\nThe magic of Granada is indescribable. It&rsquo;s vibrant, open-minded, fun, relaxed and non-judgemental. People tend to see beyond race or social class. Everyone does their own thing and everyone accepts that. You don&rsquo;t really tend to see the police about and it feels like a really safe place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>5. The cheap food</strong><br />\r\nIn Granada, the restaurants tend to be cheap anyway. Even better though, since it&rsquo;s located in Andalusia, most places will give you free tapas when you buy a drink. At my favourite tapas bar, La Riviera, you can buy a beer or glass of wine for &euro;2 and get a decent portion of food for free. I&rsquo;ve had dinner there countless times for only &euro;4 or &euro;6!<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>6. The street art</strong><br />\r\nGranada is full of creative people who love to make art. The famous Grenadian muralist, El Ni&ntilde;o de las Pinturas has street art scattered all over the city. You can see it by taking a tour or searching for an online map.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>7. It&rsquo;s ridiculously photogenic</strong><br />\r\nNormally, you have to put effort into getting somewhere to get a nice view. Not in Granada. There are easily accessible lookout spots all around the city where the views are breathtaking. Even the doorways are worth taking photos of.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>8. You can&rsquo;t be underwhelmed</strong><br />\r\nYou could stay in Granada for weeks and still not have seen everything. There is so much variety. Each bustling neighbourhood offers an alternative side to Granada. Different styles of buildings, monuments, plazas, and markets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>9. You can sunbathe at the beach and go skiing on the same da</strong>y<br />\r\nGranada has it all. And if it doesn&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s only a short drive away. I&rsquo;ve taken day trips to the natural hot springs, the beach, to snowboard, chill by a lake, hike in the mountains and see waterfalls.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Within the same day, you can ski in the snowy Sierra Nevada mountains and drive a couple of hours to beaches on the Southern coast!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>10. It will bring you back to reality</strong><br />\r\nThis small city of 234,000 inhabitants brings you back down to earth. Even compared to other cities in Spain, Granada has a unique way of life. People are real to you. There&rsquo;s no sugar coating or facade. It&rsquo;s the best place to clear your mind from any stress you&rsquo;re carrying around. Talking from experience, if you&rsquo;re really open to it, Granada can even help you to discover yourself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One thing is for sure, you won&rsquo;t be able to help to fall in love with Granada as I have.</p>",

        "Reasons_to_visit": "<h2><strong>10 reasons why you need to add the Margaret River region to your bucket list now!</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>1. Beach after beach after beach</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Beach hopping is one of the most popular activities in Margaret River. The Margaret River region has dozens and dozens of pristine beaches all along the 130 kilometer stretch of coastline. You are spoilt for choice and can enjoy the Australian summer on some of the most stunning beaches in the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to the main beaches (Meelup, Bunker Bay, Eagle Bay, Yallingup and so on), there are plenty of smaller and quieter beaches to go to if you want to avoid the &ldquo;crowds&rdquo; (it never really gets that busy except for over Christmas). Point Piquet, Castle Rock and Injidup Beach are some of my favorites.&nbsp;<strong><a href=\"https://www.yogawinetravel.com/best-beaches-in-the-margaret-river-region/\">Read more about the best beaches in the Margaret River region!</a></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>2. Whale watching tours</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The Margaret River region has an extremely long whale watching season &ndash; 6 months, to be precise! An estimated 35,000 whales migrate from the Antarctic to the warmer waters in southwest Australia. Whale watching tours June to August depart from Augusta, and September to December they depart from&nbsp;<strong><a href=\"https://www.yogawinetravel.com/best-things-to-do-in-dunsborough/\" title=\"The Best Things to Do in Dunsborough: An Idyllic Beach Town in the Margaret River Region\">Dunsborough</a></strong>&nbsp;and Busselton.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tours are inexpensive, and some companies will offer another tour if you do not spot any whales on your first tour.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.margaretriver.com/activities/whale-watching/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>More information here.</strong></a></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>3. World-class wine</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The Margaret River region produces some of the most sought after wines in the world &ndash; the region produces less than 3 per cent of Australia&rsquo;s wine, but accounts for more than a fifth of its premium wine according to&nbsp;<strong><a href=\"http://www.australia.com/en/places/wa/margaret-river.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Tourism Australia</a></strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are more than 120 wineries to explore and most of them will allow you to wander around to admire the beautiful grounds and taste their finest wine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many also serve lunch and dinner so make sure you brace yourself for a day of gluttony!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>4. Plenty of craft brewer</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Don&rsquo;t like wine? Not to worry &ndash; there are several places to get your fix of craft beer. Eagle Bay Brewery is always a crowd favorite (and serves up delicious food &ndash; try their fish burger), or you can go on a half-day brewery tour to get a taste of what each place has to offer.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>5. The perfect flat white</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Coffee lovers rejoice! Australians love their cup of joe, and have perfected the flat white (like a cafe latte, only with more coffee and less foam). Some of my favorite places for a fix include Goanna Gallery, Merchant &amp; Maker, Wild and Woods, Bunker Bay Cafe and Barnyard 1978.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can also grab a cup to go from Silver Bullet Espresso, a modified silver caravan serving up a mean coffee. They are typically parked at the Old Dunsborough Foreshore, but aren&rsquo;t always there so be sure to check their&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/silverbulletespresso/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Facebook page</strong></a>&nbsp;for updates.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>6. Food, glorious food</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>If it isn&rsquo;t already blatantly obvious, I love good food, good wine and good company. I have had some of the most incredible meals of my life in the Margaret River region! Most wineries open for lunch (make sure you call ahead and book during the peak season) so you can overlook sprawling rows of grapevines. Unfortunately, not many high quality restaurants open for dinner, so make sure you ask via phone or email to avoid disappointment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Some of my favorite breakfast joints include:</strong>&nbsp;Wild and Woods, Bunker Bay Cafe (fantastic smashed avocado on toast), Eagle Bay Brewery (get the fish burger or pizza) and Goanna Gallery (try their poached pear and homemade muesli).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Some of my favorite lunch/dinner restaurants include:</strong>&nbsp;Olio Bello (amazing pasta), Barnyard 1978 (even more amazing pasta), Blue Manna (fantastic seafood menu) and Piari &amp; Co.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>7. The Margaret River region is crowd-free!</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I can not emphasize how underrated the Margaret River region is. Western Australia accounts for approximately a third of Australia&rsquo;s land mass but receives a fraction of the number of international visitors that Sydney and Melbourne receive every year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to&nbsp;<strong><a href=\"https://www.tra.gov.au/research/International-tourism-statistics.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Tourism Research Australia</a></strong>, Sydney and Melbourne received a combined 6.9 million international visitors in the year ending September 2018. The entire state of Western Australia welcomed about 955,000 &ndash; which means that the Margaret River region received just a fraction of that!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you want to discover somewhere off the beaten track in Australia, head on over to the Margaret River region. The peak season is from December to February, but you&rsquo;ll want to avoid the week between Christmas and New Year&rsquo;s as it does get busy from domestic tourists who have the week off from work. You should also aim to avoid Leaver&rsquo;s Week, when Year 12 students celebrate the end of the academic year (i.e. get shitfaced) &ndash; this is typically in mid-November.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s still possible to visit in winter, but it does get very cold (no, not all of Australia is 40 degrees Celsius year-round!) so the beaches will be out of the question, but surfers can enjoy the winter swell!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://yogawinetravel.com/BookMargaretRiver\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Click here for a selection of accommodation options in the Margaret River region!</a>&nbsp;Tip: need some flexibility? Double check the cancellation policy &ndash; most places offer free cancellation!</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>8. Surrounded by Mother Nature</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>There is so much natural beauty in this region &ndash; from forests and caves to rock pools and hiking trails &ndash; there&rsquo;s no shortage of stunning places to see!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Make sure you check out Sugarloaf Rock, Boranup Karri Forest, The Aquarium and Injidup Natural Spa.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The region is also home to more than 100 natural caves, some as deep as a 12-storey building! There are 4&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.margaretriver.com/attractions/caves/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>show caves in the Margaret River region</strong></a>&nbsp;that are currently open to the public, and you can join semi-guided tours to explore deep underground.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Lake Cave near Boranup Forest is spectacular, or you might want to check out Ngilgi Cave &ndash; the region&rsquo;s first-ever tourist attraction.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.yogawinetravel.com/places-to-visit-in-the-margaret-river-region-australia/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>Click here for even more gorgeous places to visit in the Margaret River region.</strong></a></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>9. Breathtaking sunsets</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The Margaret River region offers up some truly amazing sunset colours &ndash; pinks, purples, oranges and fiery reds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some of the best sunset viewing spots include Sugarloaf Rock, Dunsborough foreshore and Canal Rocks.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>10. Incredible surf</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Surfing in Margaret River is one of the most popular activities, and the Margaret River region is quite possibly one of the best places to surf around the world. There are more than 70 surf breaks up and down the coast, offering fantastic surf for intermediate to advanced surfers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Popular surf spots include Boneyards, Smiths, Yallingup Main Break, Shallows, Three Bears, Gallows and Windmills. Beginners can take surf lessons at one of the many surf schools in the region.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Surf lovers should also check out the&nbsp;<strong><a href=\"http://surfingdownsouth.com.au/tag/wa-surf-gallery/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WA Surf Gallery</a></strong>&nbsp;to learn about the surfing history throughout Western Australia.</p>",
        "story1": "<p>Margaret River is the renowned surfing location and wine region of the South West of Western Australia with over 135 wineries in the area serving a variety of red and white wine, making up three percent of&nbsp;<a href=\"http://theculturetrip.com/pacific/australia/\" target=\"_blank\">Australia&rsquo;s</a>&nbsp;grape production.

This group of people set out to form the town of Augusta, and whilst repairing the severely damaged HMS Success with the local jarrah, allowing its safe return to&nbsp;<a href=\"http://theculturetrip.com/europe/united-kingdom/england/\">England</a>, they realised the potential of the area.</p>",
        "story4": "<p>By the 1850s, a group of convicts were sent to cut jarrah timber for export; however, they were recalled when they realised it was not profitable. In the same decade, John&rsquo;s brother Alfred Bussell and his wife, Ellen, built a homestead in Ellensbrook &ndash; originally a traditional&nbsp;<em>Noongar</em>&nbsp;camping area known as&nbsp;<em>Mokidup &ndash;&nbsp;</em>becoming the first settlers in the Margaret River area.</p>",

The airport is around 40 minutes from the city center. Domestic airlines serve Takamatsu from Narita, Haneda and Naha airports.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Express trains connect Takamatsu and Okayama Station in just under one hour, a major train station serving the shinkansen between Osaka and Hiroshima .</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For a different mode of travel, take the Sunrise Seto overnight train from Tokyo to Takamatsu. One of the last of its kind in Japan, this special train offers private cabins or larger compartments and comes equipped with showers and vending machines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A walk in the park</strong><br />\r\nTakamatsu is home to Ritsurin Koen Park , one of Japan&#39;s most beautiful gardens. Beautiful year round, this natural sanctuary is particularly spectacular in the spring for cherry blossom viewing, or in fall to catch vibrant autumn colors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A must for those wanting to experience a traditional Japanese garden without the fanfare of similar places, take a guided boat ride on the ponds or drink green tea in the traditional teahouse.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Island-hopping and day tripping</strong><br />\r\nJust a short walk from Takamatsu train station you&#39;ll find the ferry port, with regular boats traveling to many of the surrounding islands.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Top day trips include a visit to Japan&#39;s art island, Naoshima , which houses a number of modern art museums and installations. Also accessible by ferry is Shodoshima. Featuring golden beaches and a huge olive park, you can almost mistake your surroundings for the Mediterranean. Another option just 20 minutes away from Takamatsu is Megijima island&mdash;one of the prefecture&#39;s top cherry blossom viewing spots.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong>Of spiritual and natural beauty</strong><br />\r\nGoshikidai Plateau is a picturesque area where you can enjoy spectacular panoramas and the charm of historic temples. This chain of five mountains offers striking views of the Seto Inland Sea National Park along highway route 281.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Three of the sacred 88 temples of The Shikoku Henro, or 88 Temple Pilgrimage &nbsp;are located here, including Shiromineji Temple. Shiromineji, counted as a significant temple on the pilgrimage route, houses the tomb of Japanese emperor Sutoku (1119-1164), whose reign came to an end when he abdicated and was exiled from Kyoto. The other temples you can visit on the plateau are Negoroji Temple and Kokubunji Temple.</p>",
        "Reasons_to_visit": "<h3><strong>Visit Ritsurin Park</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The Ritsurin Park in Takamatsu is considered as one of the most beloved tourist spots for nature appreciation. It is considered as one of the main tourist attractions in the prefecture. It was originally built in the early 1600s making it one of the oldest thriving gardens in the prefecture. Inside this historical park would be tea house, museum, and souvenir shop.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What makes this garden special is the fact that visitors can do a multitude of activities in the 75-hectare land. There are walking or hiking trails that take tourists to different bridges, hills, and footpaths around the park. There are exhibitions of Japanese flora which provides an impressive scenery at any time of the year. An aspect of the garden that makes it quite popular would be the Hakomatsu which is a kind of cultivated black pine tree &ndash; a unique and interesting sight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://s3-ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/bhive-jp/media/yabai/article/3656/G3.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Ritsurin park can be accessed as early as 7:00 AM during the winter season, and 5:30 AM during Spring and Summer. The park is open throughout the year with no closing days. It could be accessed via the Ritsurinkoen Station of the local railway lines. Entry to the park usually costs 410 yen.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Stroll in the Takamatsu Castle</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>This castle is the pride and glory of Takamatsu because of its place and importance in the local history. It was built in the late 1500s by the first Feudal Lord of Takamatsu, a man belonging to the powerful Ikoma clan. It is one of the very few castles in Japan which are built with saltwater moats, a system which is designed to draw water from the sea.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Majority of the castle remains as ruins to this day but there are still a number of buildings, gates, and turrets which are from the original complex. The castle could be accessed via the Kotoden Takamatsu-Chikko station. Admission to the park usually costs about 200 yen. Opening hours are usually between 5:30 AM until about 5:00 PM with the park usually closed during the New Year holidays.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Learn History in the Kagawa Museum</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Known as a prefectural museum, this structure shows the history and art of the Kagawa prefecture. It was established to allow visitors of Takamatsu to appreciate the history of the city and the prefecture. It was originally established in 2008 which unifies three different museums from the area namely, the Seto Inland Sea Folk History Museum, Kagawa Prefectural Cultural Hall, and the Kagawa History Museum.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Inside the museum are collections and exhibits of early historical artifacts from the Yayoi and Jomon periods. There are also exhibits showing the Battle of Yashima. There are also exhibits for the modernization and development experienced by the region post-war.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Eat a bowl of Sanuki Udon</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A bowl of delicious noodles with warm broth is a great comfort food for people living in Japan. An absolute favorite would be the local delicacy of the Sanuki Udon. In Japan, there are different kinds of udon, depending on the specialty of the locality. The Sanuki Udon&rsquo;s noodle is made from a kind of wheat species which is specific only to the locality of Takamatsu. It yields chewy and firm noodles which are very enjoyable to eat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It could be served cold with a dipping sauce, or hot with delicious kelp broth. The Sanuki udon actually gained a title for being ramen&rsquo;s &ldquo;cheaper cousin&rdquo;, attributing to the cheaper cost of making or ordering a bowl of Sanuki Udon. It is very tasty yet absolutely simple, usually topped with raw eggs, chopped ginger, shredded pickled radishes, and soy sauce.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Day trip to the Seto Inland Sea</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://s3-ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/bhive-jp/media/yabai/article/3656/G4.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Seto Inland sea is, interestingly, located between Japan&rsquo;s three main islands. One of the places blessed with the sea&rsquo;s beauty would be the city of Takamatsu in Kagawa Prefecture. People usually go there to enjoy a full day of island hopping and yacht cruising. There are tours and cruises available to take people to different islands located in the Inland sea.</p>",
        "story1": "<p><strong>Takamatsu</strong>, city and capital of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/place/Kagawa\">Kagawa</a>&nbsp;<em>ken</em>&nbsp;(prefecture),&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/place/Shikoku-island-Japan\">Shikoku</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/place/Japan\">Japan</a>, facing the Inland Sea.

        "story2": "<p>The subsequent extension of railway lines and concentration of traffic in Takamatsu made the city the administrative, economic, and cultural centre of Shikoku. The city&rsquo;s industries include machinery, tools, pulp, paper, food, and furniture production.</p>",

There are excellent views across the city along the way, and keen photographers will definitely want to get snap-happy with the cityscape panoramas laid out before them once at Kelburn Lookout.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Kelburn cable car terminal is also home to the interesting&nbsp;<strong>Cable Car Museum</strong>, which displays the original cable car used on the tracks. A cable car ride is also one of the top things to do at night in Wellington. Not only do you get the chance to admire the nighttime views over the city below you, but parts of the journey, including the tunnels, are lit up with colorful displays of illuminations.

Housed in a preserved historic building that was once one of the city&#39;s early department stores, the museum features informative exhibits and film presentations that trace Wellington&#39;s maritime history and the city&#39;s evolution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In particular, the exhibits on the 1968 Wahine disaster-the sinking of the Wahine ferry near Wellington harbor during a storm claimed 51 lives and is New Zealand&#39;s worst maritime disaster-are a sobering and thoughtful reminder of the power of nature and Wellington&#39;s connection to the sea.

Designed by British architect Sir Basil Spence and built between 1964 and 1979, the building with its distinctive shape is the city&#39;s most love-it-or-hate-it piece of architecture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Next door is the more classical looking building of&nbsp;<strong>Parliament House</strong>, built in 1907 in Neoclassical Edwardian style and home to&nbsp;<strong>The Chamber</strong>&nbsp;where parliamentary debates are held.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Free one-hour tours of the parliament buildings are held daily between 10 am and 4pm and trace New Zealand&#39;s parliamentary history, as well as touring through the important government rooms.

A series of walking tracks meander through the gardens, from conifer forest areas to ferneries and seasonal flower beds. The&nbsp;<strong>Lady Norwood Rose Gardens</strong>&nbsp;here are one of the botanic gardens&#39; finest attractions, with 110 rose beds boasting a flurry of different varieties.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The&nbsp;<strong>Space Place at&nbsp;</strong><strong>Carter Observatory,&nbsp;</strong>with its planetarium show, is sited in the eastern section of the gardens (near the Wellington Cable Car Kelburn Terminal), and the gardens are also home to&nbsp;<strong>Begonia House</strong>&nbsp;with tropical flower species displays.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If possible, try to time your visit to coincide with one of the frequent summer concerts hosted here. For a fun day out, take the Wellington Cable Car, then walk back down to the city center after exploring the gardens.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And if there&#39;s time left in your day for a little more botanic garden-going, pay a visit to the interesting&nbsp;<strong>Otari Native Botanic Garden and Wilton&#39;s Bush Reserv</strong>e, located in nearby Wilton, popular for its indigenous plant life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Address: 101 Glenmore Street, Wellington</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Official site:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://wellingtongardens.nz/our-gardens/wellington-botanic-garden/\" onclick=\"ga('send', 'event', 'externalsite inline', 'site', 'https://wellingtongardens.nz/our-gardens/wellington-botanic-garden/');\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://wellingtongardens.nz/our-gardens/wellington-botanic-garden/</a></p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>6.

Katherine Mansfield House &amp; Garden</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>This small wooden house in the Wellington suburb of Thorndon was the childhood home of New Zealand&#39;s most famous author. Katherine Mansfield (1888-1923) was a short story writer whose modernist prose has been highly influential both in her home country and overseas. Most of the writing she became famous for was completed in London, where she moved as an adult and was friends with D.H. Lawrence and Virginia Woolf.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The house where she was born and grew up has been restored to its original condition and is now a museum housing many of Mansfield&#39;s personal belongings, as well as typical furniture and fixtures of the late 19th century.

Nairn Street Cottage &amp; The Colonial Cottage Museum</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Wellington&#39;s oldest surviving original home, the Nairn Street Cottage, was built by William Wallis in the 1850s as a home for his family. It has been painstakingly preserved with many of the family&#39;s original 19th-century furniture and fixtures in place to recreate the ambience of life in New Zealand&#39;s pioneering era, while outside is an organic heritage garden.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Entry to the house is via a guided tour (four times daily) that allows visitors a taste of colonial Wellington and details the history of the Wallis family who lived here for three generations.

During the pre-European era, Matiu Island-the largest of three northern islands in Wellington harbor-was occupied by Maori.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the modern era, it was used as a quarantine station, internment camp, and military installation until being turned over to New Zealand&#39;s Department of Conservation as a nature reserve.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For both day-trippers and overnighters, the island has a series of short&nbsp;<strong>hiking trails</strong>&nbsp;up to its highest point, with World War II gun emplacements, and around the its perimeter, all with excellent views across to the mainland.

The zoo&#39;s animal hospital, known as The Nest, can be visited to see the work of the zoo&#39;s veterinarian staff.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other fun things to do here include daily animal talks, feeding experiences, creature encounters, exploring the adventure playgrounds, and even zoo sleepovers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Address: 200 Daniell Street, Newton, Wellington</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Official site:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://wellingtonzoo.com/\" onclick=\"ga('send', 'event', 'externalsite inline', 'site', 'https://wellingtonzoo.com/');\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://wellingtonzoo.com/</a></p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>14.

Topping out at 196 meters high, this peak offers fantastic views over the cityscape, although it can be extremely windy on top. A narrow winding road, signposted &quot;Lookout,&quot; runs up from Oriental Bay to the Byrd Memorial below the viewing platform.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From the terrace on the summit there is a magnificent panorama of the broad city, the harbor, and Cook Strait in one direction and Kelburn Park with the university buildings in the other. The&nbsp;<strong>Byrd Memorial</strong>&nbsp;commemorates the American aviator, Richard Byrd, who in 1929 made the first flight over the South Pole from his base in New Zealand</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Location: Access off Kent Terrace, Wellington</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>15.

Both&nbsp;<strong>Queen&#39;s Wharf</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Frank Kitts Park</strong>&nbsp;are surrounded by fine buildings, including the Civic Centre and the Museum of New Zealand. From Frank Kitts Park, there is a good view of Wellington Harbour, and the park hosts a market every Saturday. There are plenty of caf&eacute;s and restaurants in this area, so it&#39;s a great place for a pit stop while strolling the central city.</p>",
        "Reasons_to_visit": "<p>Wellington is New Zealand&rsquo;s capital. It&rsquo;s a small, hip city on the coast of the country&rsquo;s North Island.

Here are 11 things that Singapore is best known for.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Being super clean</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Singapore is renowned for having some of the cleanest streets in the world, largely due to a 50,000-strong cleaning workforce employed to keep the streets clean. Singapore is also known for its strict laws on littering, spitting on the streets, vandalism and public urination that can result in heavy fines and/or a punishment called Corrective Work Order, where offenders are required to pick up litter in public wearing a bright vest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://img.theculturetrip.com/450x/smart/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/singapore-green-trash-bin-pittaya.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Don&#39;t litter in Singapore&nbsp;|&nbsp;&copy; Pittaya/Flickr</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Greenery amidst the city</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Singapore has a reputation as the Garden City, evident in how well manicured and lush the public spaces and even the roads are. While much of the agricultural and wild landscapes were cleared to make way for the growing population, efforts have been made to introduce some greenery into the concrete jungle &ndash; besides&nbsp;<a href=\"https://theculturetrip.com/asia/singapore/articles/the-10-most-beautiful-parks-and-gardens-in-singapore/\">public parks</a>&nbsp;amidst the tall buildings, you will often seen flowers and bushes lining the overhead bridges, or tall shady trees planed along the central divider of the expressways.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://img.theculturetrip.com/450x/smart/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/singapore-expressway-landscaping-jnzl.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Plants along Singapore&#39;s Expressways&nbsp;|&nbsp;&copy; jnzl/Flickr</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>That ban on chewing gum</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Many people remember Singapore as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://theculturetrip.com/asia/singapore/articles/why-singapore-banned-chewing-gum/\">that place you can&rsquo;t chew gum in</a>, a rule implemented in 1992 to combat the disruptions gum was causing on the then-newly launched subway system, and involved heavy fines to anyone caught sticking their gum in unwanted places. While rules are generally more relaxed today and you can bring in gum for your own consumption, you still will not find gum sold anywhere around the island unless you visit the pharmacy with a doctor&rsquo;s prescription for nicotine or dental gum.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BOOK THE TRAVEL YOU&#39;VE MISSED</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://img.theculturetrip.com/450x/smart/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/chewing-gum-shoe-mahaliestackpole.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>One reason why Singapore banned chewing gum&nbsp;|&nbsp;&copy; Mahalie Stackpole/Flickr</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>The Marina Bay Skyline</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Singapore&rsquo;s skyline has changed dramatically in the last 10 years with the introduction of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://theculturetrip.com/asia/singapore/articles/history-of-marina-bay-sands-in-1-minute/\">Marina Bay Sands</a>&nbsp;&ndash; can you believe that this entire Marina Bay area used to be an empty plot of reclaimed land and sea water? The view is especially beautiful at night where you can find other iconic structures like the Esplanade, Helix Bridge,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://theculturetrip.com/asia/singapore/articles/what-exactly-is-singapores-merlion-anyway/\">Merlion</a>&nbsp;and the numerous skyscrapers of the Central Business and Marina Bay Financial Districts all lit up, the temperature perfect for an after-dinner stroll.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://img.theculturetrip.com/450x/smart/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Marina-bay-Light-show.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Marina Bay light show&nbsp;|&nbsp;&copy; heikelindner / Flickr</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Fines and corporal punishment</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Tourist t-shirts often call Singapore a &lsquo;fine city&rsquo; thanks to the number of laws and regulations that can result in a hefty fine if flouted, these can range from smoking in no-smoking areas, jaywalking or even eating and drinking on the MRT. More serious infractions like robbery, vandalism or drug trafficking in Singapore can result in jail sentences, but also corporal punishment like caning or even a death sentence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://img.theculturetrip.com/450x/smart/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/singapore-fine-signs.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fine signs in Singapore&nbsp;|&nbsp;&copy; Andrea Schaffer/Flickr</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Inventing the Singapore Sling</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the tourist must-dos in Singapore is to head to Long Bar at the iconic Raffles Hotel for a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://theculturetrip.com/asia/singapore/articles/a-brief-history-of-the-singapore-sling/\">Singapore Sling</a>&nbsp;cocktail and the novelty of throwing all your peanut shells on the floor. This pretty cherry-pink cocktail consisting of angostura bitters, grenadine and gin among other liqueurs was invented by a bartender back in the early 1900s and became the quintessential &lsquo;Singaporean drink&rsquo; that visitors had to partake in on a Singaporean vacation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://img.theculturetrip.com/450x/smart/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/6184855319_57e8a0e9da_b.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Singapore Sling from The Long Bar at Raffles Hotel&nbsp;|&nbsp;&copy; VasenkaPhotography / Flickr</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Year round summer (and stickiness)</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Located almost upon the equator, Singapore&rsquo;s temperatures usually range from 28-34 degrees Celsius all year round and feels like summer&nbsp;<a href=\"https://theculturetrip.com/asia/singapore/articles/whens-the-best-time-of-the-year-to-visit-singapore/\">all year round</a>. There is also high humidity which can mean a lot of sweating, which is why many locals prefer to hide in indoor air-conditioning during the blistering midday heat. Expect short torrential rainfall just about anytime of the year as well, though it usually picks up during the monsoon period at the end of the year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://img.theculturetrip.com/450x/smart/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/singapore-helix-bridge-khendilee.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Singapore Helix Bridge KhendiLee&nbsp;|&nbsp;&copy; Khendi Lee / Unsplash</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>The land of shopping malls</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://theculturetrip.com/asia/singapore/articles/a-guide-to-shopping-until-you-drop-on-orchard-road/\">Orchard Road</a>&nbsp;is perhaps the most busy stretch of road in Singapore, a 2.2km stretch with many&nbsp;<a href=\"https://theculturetrip.com/asia/singapore/articles/a-guide-to-singapores-luxury-shopping-malls/\">luxury shopping malls</a>&nbsp;lining the road on both sides, and sees locals and tourists alike crowd the malls on weekends. These days, almost every major district in Singapore has a mall of its own, often a popular hangout spot for nearby residents who want to grab a bite, do a spot of shopping or just enjoy the air-conditioning comfort on a hot afternoon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://img.theculturetrip.com/450x/smart/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/singapore-shopping-stb.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shopping along Orchard Road&nbsp;|&nbsp;Courtesy Singapore Tourism Board</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Having an awesome airport and airline</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Singapore&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://theculturetrip.com/asia/singapore/articles/guide-to-changi-singapore-the-worlds-best-airport-since-2013/\">Changi Airport</a>&nbsp;is one of the best places to have a layover, a large modern facility with amenities like a free cinema, flower gardens and even a swimming pool for visitors arriving or passing through Singapore. Changi Airport is also the base for national carrier Singapore Airlines, famed for its iconic Singapore Girl flight attendants and service that consistently garners global recognition as one of the best airlines to fly with.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://img.theculturetrip.com/450x/smart/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/23841997230_620b632ee5_k.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Take a breather at the many cosy lounges in Changi Airport&nbsp;|&nbsp;&copy; Steve Lacey/Flickr</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Cheap and good street food</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Hotels and activities in Singapore may not always be the cheapest, but visitors love that its street food has remained relatively cheap while having high hygiene and quality. Locals and tourists alike brave the humidity to feast in any of the country&rsquo;s many hawker centres, filled with a large variety of local and regional food stalls &ndash; a favourite way to experience Singaporean culture. Some of Singapore&rsquo;s best hawker food stalls have even managed to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://theculturetrip.com/asia/singapore/articles/singapores-michelin-star-meals-for-less-than-5/\">garner Michelin stars</a>, a world first.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://img.theculturetrip.com/450x/smart/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/singapore-alexandra-village-hawker-centre-tiberiu-ana.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Alexandra Village Hawker Centre&nbsp;|&nbsp;&copy; Tiberiu Ana / Flickr</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Lee Kuan Yew</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>If there is one Singaporean who people around the world can name, chances are that it is Singapore&rsquo;s first prime minister Lee Kuan Yew. Often regarded as the founding father of independent Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew was known for his frankness and hard edge, and was the driving force behind instituting some of famous things Singapore is known for listed in this article, like the garden city and strict laws. His passing in 2015 was a day of national mourning for the country, and his son Lee Hsien Loong is currently Singapore&rsquo;s third prime minister.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://img.theculturetrip.com/450x/smart/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/lee-kuan-yew-robertdward.jpg\" /></p>",
