1. Initially, i used git bash for the creation of related files inside the project.
	i) here i have created a vitual environment(env) from git shell for the installing of all the required packages on further 	proceding of the project.
	
	ii) before installing the required packages i'll have to activate Script(source env/Scripts/activate),
	now (pip freeze: it will show installed packages.), (first package: pip install django==3.0.7)
