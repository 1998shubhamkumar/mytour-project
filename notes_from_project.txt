1. Initially, i used git bash for the creation of related files inside the project.
	i) here i have created a vitual environment(env) from git shell for the installing of all the required packages on further 	proceding of the project.
	
	ii) before installing the required packages i'll have to activate Script(source env/Scripts/activate),
	now (pip freeze: it will show installed packages.), (first package: pip install django==3.0.7)

2. Initiate a git repository to update and track records of all the codes changes. But I don't want to push all the files on github(like media files, user authentication credentials, keys etc). So, created .gitignore file in the main path of the project. Go to 
gitignore.io and search for django, copy all the contents and paste it into the .gitignore file.
	i) for example if i don't want to push media, then paste the loction of media folder here: # pytype static type analyzer
	available in .gitignore file.

3. Now i have to make a folder called static to store all the files realted to the project.
	i) In settings.py file of mytour app: manually add path of the static files as: STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR,'static')
		STATICFILES_DIR = [
    		os.path.join(BASE_DIR,'mytour/static'),
		]
	ii) Now my task is to check the status of the static files as : python manage.py collectstatic, it will also create a seperate 		static files with "admin" support.
